Executive Overview\\nThe iLibrary Backend is a Spring Boot monolithic application designed as a comprehensive RESTful API for\\nmanaging a private study-library system. It addresses typical library needs: user account management, role-\\nbased  access,  subscription  plans,  real-time  seat  booking,  and  secure  entry  via  QR  codes.  For\\nexample, a student can sign up, purchase a weekly or monthly pass, reserve a study seat for a set duration,\\nreceive a QR code by email, and then scan it for library access. All core logic – authentication, payment\\nprocessing,  and  seat  management  –  is  implemented  within  a  single  deployable  service  (no  separate\\nmicroservices) for simplicity and cohesion.\\nLLM Fine-Tuning & RAG Context: The repository’s clear structure and rich documentation (interactive API\\ndocs, diagrams, and thorough README) make it well-suited for integration into an LLM-based knowledge\\nsystem. In a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, the system’s documentation and data can be\\nindexed as factual knowledge to reduce hallucinations and provide up-to-date information. In other\\nwords, the code and docs are written to be “AI-readable”: endpoints and business logic use consistent\\nterminology (users, bookings, subscriptions), and the architecture is documented so that an LLM can be\\nfine-tuned on the project’s actual functionality. This makes it possible for a future AI assistant to answer\\nquestions  about  how  the  library  system  works  or  even  to  generate  query-specific  answers  using  the\\ncodebase as a knowledge source.\\nHigh-Level Architecture: The system follows a 3-tier monolithic architecture: a client (web/mobile front-\\nend) sends HTTP(S) requests to the Spring Boot API server , which handles business logic and interacts with\\nthe underlying databases and external services. A simplified ASCII diagram of the high-level flow is shown\\nbelow. \\n+-----------+         +------------------+         +--------+\\n|  Client   | --HTTP->| iLibrary Backend | --SQL-->| MySQL  |\\n| (Frontend)|         |  (Spring Boot)   |         | Database|\\n+-----------+         +------------------+         +--------+\\n                          |    |   |   \\\\\\n                          v    v   v    v\\n                        [Redis][JavaMail][Stripe]\\n- Client: The front-end (could be a web app or mobile app) communicates via REST API calls (JSON over\\nHTTP) to the backend.\\n- Spring Boot API: Implements controllers and services for each domain (auth, booking, payment). This\\nsingle server uses Spring Security for auth, and Spring Data JPA (Hibernate) to talk to MySQL.\\n- MySQL: A relational database storing all entities (users, seats, bookings, payments, etc.).\\n- Redis: Used as a cache to store frequently accessed data such as seat availability, improving performance\\n.\\n1 2\\n3\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n1'),\n",

Stripe webhook events and email\\nsending are integrated so that the backend can react to external payment events or send out messages\\nasynchronously as needed.\\nNon-Goals  and  Design  Trade-offs: iLibrary-Backend  does  not include  a  front-end  UI  (this  is  strictly  a\\nbackend service), nor does it implement a large-scale microservices architecture. The decision to use a\\nsingle monolithic app was a trade-off for simplicity and ease of development: as noted by industry sources,\\nmonoliths allow fast development and easier deployment in the early stages of a project. However , this\\nmeans  all  features  share  one  codebase  and  deployment.  We  explicitly  omitted  complex  features  like\\ndistributed caching, multi-tenant support, and a dedicated reporting service. Authentication is done via\\nstateless JWT tokens (instead of server-side sessions), trading off the complexity of token management for\\nthe scalability and decoupling benefits of RESTful auth. The system uses MySQL with Hibernate (for\\nstrong relational consistency) rather than a NoSQL store, which is a deliberate choice favoring transactional\\nintegrity of bookings over eventual consistency. Real-time seat tracking is implemented with database +\\nRedis  caching,  rather  than  a  full  event-driven  messaging  queue,  to  balance  responsiveness  with\\nimplementation complexity.\\nOverall, the architecture is  logical and clear: one unified backend service handles all library operations.\\nThis  monolithic  design  was  chosen  for  rapid  development  and  because  the  domain  is  tightly  coupled\\n(authorization, booking, payments, and notifications all interrelate). Future scaling (if needed) can leverage\\nhorizontal container deployment (the app is Dockerized) rather than splitting into microservices at this\\nstage.\\n2. System Architecture (Deep Dive)\\nMonolith vs Microservices\\nThe iLibrary system is designed as a  monolithic application rather than a collection of microservices. In\\npractice this means all functionality (controllers, services, persistence, security, etc.) lives in one codebase\\nand one running process. This was a conscious choice: monolithic architectures can significantly speed up\\ndevelopment and simplify deployment since there is a single executable unit. For a moderately sized\\nsystem like this, splitting into microservices would add complexity (service discovery, multiple deployments,\\nnetwork overhead) without proportional benefit. As Atlassian notes, a monolith’s primary advantage is fast\\ndevelopment  due  to  simplicity  of  one  codebase.  In  iLibrary’s  case,  features  like  booking  and\\nsubscription are closely coupled (e.g. buying a subscription affects booking limits), so a unified codebase\\navoids complicated inter-service communication. \\nComponent  Interaction  Flow: Internally,  iLibrary  follows  a  layered  structure.  Controllers  (Spring\\n@RestController classes) define REST endpoints (e.g. /public/signup, /booking/seat, /admin/\\nallUsers ). Each controller typically calls a  Service class to handle business logic (e.g. booking\\ncreation, payment processing). The service layer uses Repository interfaces (Spring Data JPA) to query or\\n5\\n6\\n7 6\\n5\\n6\\n6\\n8 9\\n2'),\n",

For example, the flow for a booking request is:\\n1. Client sends POST /booking/seat with JSON data.\\n2.  The  BookingController receives  it  (after  passing  authentication)  and  maps  it  to  a\\nSeatBookingRequest DTO.\\n3. The controller calls BookingService.bookSeat(...), passing the validated DTO.\\n4. BookingService may check seat availability, create a new Booking entity, update the Seat entity’s\\nstatus, and save changes in one transaction.\\n5. After saving, the service enqueues an email (QR code) and returns a success response. \\nExternally,  the  app  interacts  synchronously  with  two  main  external  components:  the  Stripe  API for\\npayments (via REST and webhooks), and an email SMTP server via JavaMail. These interactions are modeled\\nas outbound calls in the service layer . For example, initiating a subscription purchase triggers a redirect to\\nStripe; when Stripe later posts a webhook, a  WebhookController in the app processes it (marking the\\nsubscription as active). Email sending is typically done asynchronously (Spring Boot can dispatch emails\\non a separate thread). \\nSync vs Async Boundaries: Most of the application runs synchronously. HTTP requests enter , go through\\nSpring  MVC  to  controllers,  and  the  processing  completes  within  the  request  thread  (often  in  one\\ntransaction). The only asynchronous aspects are:\\n-  Email Notifications: Sending an email to a user (e.g. welcome message or QR code) is done without\\nblocking the main request (handled by Spring’s async task executor).\\n-  Stripe Webhooks: These are inherently asynchronous events that the server receives at any time (e.g.\\nwhen  a  payment  succeeds).  The  app  handles  them  in  special  controller  endpoints  (/webhook/\\nsubscription and /webhook/seat).\\n- Caching: Redis is used to cache data reads. This operates transparently in the background, but does not\\nintroduce custom messaging queues into the request flow. \\nThus, the primary failure boundaries are still synchronous. If any synchronous call (database, Stripe REST\\ncall, etc.) fails or times out, an exception is thrown back to the client. Webhook processing and email\\nsending failures are logged or retried internally.\\nData Flow Example: A typical user signup and booking flow is illustrated below (building on the sequence\\ndiagram in the docs ):\\n-  User Signup: The user submits  /public/signup (with username, email, password). The controller\\nvalidates inputs (@Valid), prefixes the username with ROLE_USER, hashes the password using BCrypt,\\nand saves a new User entity to MySQL. A welcome email is sent asynchronously. The API returns HTTP\\n201 Created.\\n-  User  Login: The  user  calls  /public/login with  credentials.  Spring’s  AuthenticationManager\\nverifies them against the database (comparing the BCrypt hash). On success, the server creates a JWT\\ntoken (signed with HS256 and a secret key) with the username and role claim, and returns it to the client\\n. The client stores the token.\\n- Authenticated Request: For a protected operation (e.g. booking a seat), the client includes the JWT in the\\nAuthorization header  (“Bearer  …”).  A  JwtRequestFilter intercepts  the  request:  it  extracts  and\\nvalidates the token signature and expiration, and if valid, sets the Spring Security context with the user’s\\nidentity and roles (from token claims). The request is then forwarded to the appropriate controller\\nmethod (e.g. BookingController.bookSeat()).\\n-  Booking and Check-in: When booking, the server creates a  Booking record (status PENDING) and\\n10\\n10\\n1 11\\n11\\n12\\n7\\n13\\n14\\n3'),\n",

It sends the QR token to the user by email. Later , when the user scans the QR code\\nat the library, the front-end posts it back to  /librarian/verify-qr. The controller decodes the JWT\\nembedded in the QR, marks the booking as CONFIRMED in the DB, and allows entry. \\nFailure Propagation: If any step fails (e.g. database down, invalid input, expired token), an exception is\\nthrown and handled by Spring’s exception mechanisms. For instance, invalid JWT results in an HTTP 401\\nUnauthorized. Form validation errors result in 400 Bad Request (handled by  @ControllerAdvice or\\nSpring’s default). Uncaught exceptions typically return 500 Internal Server Error , with logging. Failures in\\nasynchronous tasks (like email send) are logged and can be retried or alerted via monitoring. In short,\\nfailures bubble up to the API level, ensuring clients get appropriate HTTP error codes and messages.\\n3. Repository Walkthrough (Folder-by-Folder)\\nThe repository has a simple layout:\\n.idea/ – IDE configuration files (IntelliJ). These contain project settings and should not be removed\\nonly if developers rely on them, but they are not needed for compiling or running the app. If\\nremoved, only the IDE settings break (not the code).\\nER-Diagram.png – An ER diagram image illustrating the database schema. It is purely\\ndocumentation. Removing it does not affect the code, but one loses the visual schema aid.\\nREADME.md – The main documentation (which we are analyzing). It contains project overview, API\\ndocs, and instructions. Removing or altering it does not stop the application from running, but\\nseverely hampers onboarding and understanding. All the sequence diagrams, config examples, and\\nschemas we reference come from this file.\\niLibrary/ – This is the Spring Boot application code directory. It contains source (src/main/\\njava and src/main/resources), pom.xml, Docker configuration, etc. This is the core of the\\nproject. Removing iLibrary/ would break everything (no code to compile or run). Inside it,\\npackages are organized by function:\\nControllers ( com.ilibrary.controller or similar): Java classes annotated with \\n@RestController, each mapping URLs to methods. Examples: PublicController (handles /\\npublic/* endpoints), BookingController ( /booking), SubscriptionController ( /\\nsubscription), AdminController ( /admin), PaymentController ( /payment), and \\nWebhookController ( /webhook). These classes orchestrate request handling and use Service\\nclasses.\\nModels/Entities ( com.ilibrary.model): JPA entity classes representing the database tables (e.g. \\nUser, Seat, Booking, Subscription, Payment, etc.).

They often have annotations like @Entity and define relationships (@ManyToOne, \\n@OneToMany).\\nDTOs ( com.ilibrary.dto): Data Transfer Objects used for request and response payloads (e.g. \\nSignupRequest, LoginRequest, SeatBookingRequest, etc.). These are distinct from Entities\\nand often have validation annotations.\\nRepositories ( com.ilibrary.repository): Interfaces extending JpaRepository for each\\nEntity. For example, UserRepository, BookingRepository, etc. These provide CRUD database\\naccess. Removing any repository would break database interactions for its entity.\\nServices ( com.ilibrary.service): Classes with business logic (e.g. UserService, \\nBookingService). Controllers delegate to these. If a service is removed, the related functionality\\ncollapses.\\nSecurity ( com.ilibrary.security): Configuration classes for JWT, filters, and Spring Security\\nsettings.

Also contains schema.sql or data.sql if any, and static files like application.yml,\\nthough not explicitly listed.\\nDockerfile/docker-compose.yml: There is likely a Dockerfile in iLibrary/ and perhaps a \\ndocker-compose.yml in the root. The README’s Docker section suggests these exist.\\nRemoving the Dockerfile means you cannot easily containerize the app without rewriting that file.\\nAn example flow through these modules: A call to /booking/seat enters BookingController. The\\ncontroller validates input DTO, then calls BookingService. The service may call SeatRepository and\\nBookingRepository to update the database. It might also call EmailService to send a QR code. Each\\nmodule interacts via clearly defined interfaces (e.g., controllers know services by interface, services know\\nrepositories, etc.). None of these folders function in isolation: for instance, controllers depend on services\\nand DTOs; services depend on repositories and entities.\\nIn summary,  the  iLibrary/ directory is the core; it defines all functionality.

Backend (Spring Boot)\\nController Design\\nThe backend exposes a REST API with clearly segmented controllers. Generally, each major function has its\\nown controller class: -  PublicController – handles unauthenticated or initial calls (e.g.  POST /public/\\nsignup,  POST /public/login,  GET /public/healthCheck) . These endpoints do not require\\nJWT tokens (except for health-check). - BookingController – handles /booking namespace, e.g. POST /\\nbooking/seat to book a seat,  DELETE /booking/cancel to cancel a booking. These endpoints\\nrequire an authenticated user . -  SubscriptionController – handles  /subscription endpoints (GET, \\nPATCH for viewing and renewing subscriptions). -  AdminController – under  /admin (e.g.  GET /\\nadmin/allUsers,  /admin/allSeats,  /admin/allBooking,  /admin/allSubscription) .\\nAccess restricted to admin roles.\\n- PaymentController – /payment endpoints that initiate Stripe checkout for seats or subscriptions.\\n- WebhookController – /webhook endpoints for Stripe to POST events when payments complete or fail\\n. \\nEach  controller  is  annotated  with  @RestController and  request-mapping  annotations\\n( @RequestMapping, @PostMapping, etc.). Controllers are intentionally thin: they map HTTP requests to\\nservice methods. For example, a booking controller method might look like: \\n@PostMapping(\"/booking/seat\")\\npublicResponseEntity<?>bookSeat(@RequestBody@ValidSeatBookingRequestreq,\\nAuthenticationauth) {\\nBookingResponseres= bookingService.bookSeat(req, auth.getName());\\nreturnResponseEntity.ok(res);\\n}\\nKey design points: - Use of DTOs ( @Valid SeatBookingRequest) to validate JSON input. Controllers do\\nnot accept Entity objects directly from the client. - Controllers catch high-level exceptions or rely on a \\n@ControllerAdvice to convert them into HTTP responses (e.g. return 400 for validation errors). -\\nEndpoint security is mostly configured elsewhere (Spring Security config), but controllers assume a valid\\nauthenticated user if needed (obtained via Spring Security’s Authentication object).\\nDTO vs Entity\\nThe code cleanly separates DTOs (data transfer objects) from Entities. Entities (JPA models) represent the\\ndatabase  tables  with  @Entity annotations.  For  instance,  UserEntity has  fields  id,  username, \\npasswordHash, email, role, etc. These entities are managed by Hibernate. By contrast, DTO classes\\n(e.g.  UserSignupRequest,  SeatBookingRequest, etc.) are simple POJOs used for request bodies or\\n8\\n19\\n19\\n9\\n10\\n10\\n6'),\n",

They usually have validation annotations (@NotNull, @Size,\\netc.) and no persistence logic. \\nWhen a controller receives a request, it binds JSON into a DTO, validates it (@Valid), and then maps it to\\nan Entity or passes it to a service. Service methods then instantiate or update Entities. This separation\\nensures that the external API schema is decoupled from the internal data model. For example, a signup\\nrequest DTO might include  username and  password, but the  UserEntity has a  passwordHash\\ninstead of raw password.\\nValidation Approach\\nInput validation is consistently applied using Spring’s Bean Validation (Hibernate Validator). All request\\nDTOs include annotations like @NotBlank, @Email, or custom validators. Controllers often use @Valid\\non @RequestBody parameters. The sequence diagram shows “Validate input (@Valid)” before processing\\nsignup . Invalid inputs automatically result in 400 responses with error details. This aligns with the\\nREADME’s mention of bean validation for all inputs. Additionally, the code likely has global exception\\nhandling (@ControllerAdvice) to catch validation errors and format them. \\nJWT Authentication (Step-by-Step)\\nThe  system  uses  JWT  tokens  for  stateless  authentication.  The  flow  is  as  follows  (also  outlined  in  the\\nREADME’s sequence diagrams):\\nUser Registration (/public/signup):\\nController receives signup data (username, password, email). \\nIt calls a UserService which: \\nValidates the data (format, uniqueness). \\nPrefixes the username with ROLE_ (e.g. “ROLE_USER”) to align with Spring Security’s\\nauthority convention. \\nHashes the password using BCrypt and sets it in a new User entity . \\nSaves the entity to the database (userRepository.save(...)). \\nSends a welcome email (asynchronously) via EmailService. \\nController returns HTTP 201 Created on success. \\nUser Login (/public/login):\\nController receives credentials (username, password). \\nIt uses Spring Security’s AuthenticationManager to authenticate. The manager loads the user\\nfrom DB and compares the BCrypt hash. \\nUpon successful authentication, the controller generates a JWT: \\nIt invokes a JwtUtil.generateToken(username, roles) utility . \\nThe utility creates a token payload with the subject (username) and authorities (e.g. \\nROLE_USER) and signs it using the HS256 algorithm and a secret key (from \\napplication.properties). The README notes a 10-hour expiration for tokens. \\nThe JWT (and user roles) are returned to the client (typically in the response body as JSON). \\n11\\n20\\n11 12\\n1. \\n2. \\n3. \\n◦ \\n◦ \\n11\\n◦ 11\\n◦ \\n◦ \\n4. 11\\n5. \\n6. \\n7. \\n8. \\n◦ 7\\n◦ \\n7\\n9. \\n7'),\n",

For example, endpoints under /admin\\nrequire ROLE_ADMIN, while most /booking and /subscription endpoints require at least \\nROLE_USER. Spring Security is set up (likely in a WebSecurityConfig class) with\\n.antMatchers(\"/admin/**\").hasRole(\"ADMIN\"), etc. This enforces the Role-Based Access\\nControl (RBAC) mentioned in the docs. An authenticated user with only ROLE_USER would get\\n403 Forbidden if they hit an /admin endpoint. \\nThis JWT setup provides a  multi-layered security architecture with stateless tokens, as promised in the\\nREADME . The key steps (validate credentials, generate token, verify on each request) are all handled\\nby Spring components and the custom filter as shown above.\\nSecurity Boundaries and Edge Cases\\nSecurity boundaries are clearly defined by roles and token presence. Public endpoints (/public/*) are\\nopen to anyone. All other endpoints require a valid JWT. Within those, access is further restricted: - User vs\\nAdmin: An admin user (with ROLE_ADMIN) can perform administrative tasks like viewing all bookings or\\nuser accounts. Regular users cannot.\\n-  Librarian Role: The system mentions a “librarian” role for scanning QR codes, though in practice this\\nmight just be an admin or staff user .

Fields include id (PK), username, passwordHash, email, role\\n(e.g. USER, ADMIN, LIBRARIAN), and timestamp metadata. Each user has one role (simple string\\nenum). \\nSubscriptions: Each represents a user’s subscription plan (weekly, monthly, yearly). Fields: id, \\ntype (enum), amount, start_date, end_date, and status (active/ expired). There is a\\nforeign key user_id linking to the Users table. Thus, one-to-many relationship: a user can have\\nmultiple subscription records over time (or just one active one). We ensure a user’s current\\nsubscription is enforced in business logic. \\nSubscription_Payments: Records payments for subscriptions. Fields: id, stripeSessionId, \\nsubscription_id (FK to Subscriptions), transactionDate, status, amount, and \\nuser_id. Each payment links to a specific subscription. This table tracks Stripe charges (webhook\\nevents update the status). \\nSeats: Represents an actual library seat. Fields: id, location (e.g. room/floor), seat_number,\\nand status ( available or booked). Seat is fairly static; we preload seats in the database (if\\napplicable) and users can change status via bookings. \\nBookings: A booking attempt by a user . Fields: id, booking_date, start_time, hours\\n(duration), seat_id (FK to Seats), user_id (FK to Users), and status ( PENDING, \\nCONFIRMED, CANCELLED, etc.). A booking is linked many-to-one to both a user and a seat (one\\nuser can have many bookings over time; one seat can have many bookings but only one active at a\\ntime). The schema enforces seat_id as a foreign key to ensure referential integrity. \\nSeat_Payments: Payments for booking fees. Fields: id, stripeSessionId, seat_id (FK to\\nSeats or to Bookings?), transactionDate, status, amount, user_id. This logs payment\\ntransactions related to seats (though the exact relationship to booking may be one-to-one if\\npayment triggers booking).\\nRelationships: The ER diagram shows these relations: -  User → Subscription: One user can have multiple\\nsubscriptions (history). The Subscriptions table has user_id as FK. - User → Booking: One user can\\nmake many bookings. The Bookings table has user_id as FK. - Seat → Booking: One seat can appear in\\nmany  bookings  (over  different  times);  the  Bookings table  has  seat_id as  FK.  -  Subscription  →\\nSubscription_Payment: One  subscription  record  can  have  multiple  payments  if  it’s  renewed;\\nsubscription_payments.subscription_id is an FK. - Booking → Seat_Payment: Possibly one booking\\ncorresponds to one payment; the schema likely relates seat_payments.seat_id (or booking_id) to\\nthe booking. - Other FK constraints enforce data consistency (e.g. deleting a user cascades or is restricted\\nwith related subscriptions/bookings).\\nIndexes and Constraints: Primary keys (usually auto-generated IDs) on each table ensure uniqueness.\\nThere are unique constraints where needed, e.g. username in Users. Foreign keys enforce valid references\\n(e.g.  booking.seat_id must  exist  in  Seats).  Indexes  should  exist  on  foreign  key  columns  for\\nperformance (e.g. index on  user_id in Bookings,  seat_id, etc.). The Spring JPA entities likely use\\n@ManyToOne and @OneToMany to model these relationships, and JPA automatically adds the necessary\\nforeign keys and indexes.\\nTransaction  Handling: The  service  layer  methods  that  create  or  update  multiple  tables  use  Spring’s\\n@Transactional to ensure atomicity. For example, booking a seat would involve: updating the Seats\\ntable (mark as booked), inserting into Bookings, and possibly inserting a Seat_Payment record.

Similarly, user signup and subscription\\npurchase are each wrapped in transactions. Since Stripe and emailing occur outside the DB transaction, the\\ncode must handle rollback (e.g. if sending email fails after DB commit, the booking remains in DB; if a\\ncritical failure occurs, the service may throw an exception to rollback).\\nData Consistency & Failure Scenarios: The design assumes that business rules are enforced at the service\\nlevel (e.g. preventing double-booking a seat). Concurrency control is important: for example, two users\\ntrying to book the same seat at once could cause a race. Ideally, the application would use database locking\\nor  versioning  (optimistic  locking  via  @Version)  on  the  Seat  entity.  If  not  implemented,  a  conflicting\\nupdate might cause an error which should be caught and translated to “Seat already booked” message. \\nFailure scenarios: If the database is unreachable, the app will throw an exception on startup or request, and\\nreturn 500 errors for all endpoints. Partially completed operations will be rolled back by transactions. For\\nexternal  payments,  if  a  Stripe  webhook  is  not  received  (e.g.  network  issue),  a  Subscription might\\nremain in “pending” state; the system should handle retrying or manual reconciliation. The README does\\nnot detail every DB failure, but good practice would include error logging and possibly retry logic in the\\nservice methods.\\n9. Security Deep Dive\\nThreat Model\\nThe main threats to consider are: unauthorized data access, injection attacks, replay of credentials, and\\nabuse  of  resources.  The  system’s  defense-in-depth is  illustrated  in  the  README.  Key  security\\nmeasures include:\\nAuthentication & Authorization: JWT tokens with short expiration (10 hours) are used. Secrets\\nare kept server-side, so forging tokens is infeasible if the secret key is secure. Users must re-\\nauthenticate after token expiry. Role-based access ensures users can only hit endpoints meant for\\nthem (e.g. only admins can delete or view all users).\\nPassword Security: User passwords are never stored in plaintext; they are hashed with BCrypt (a\\nstrong adaptive hashing function). This mitigates risks if the user database is compromised. \\nInput Validation: All user inputs are validated (@Valid bean validation). This stops malformed or\\nmalicious input (e.g. SQL injection attempts) at the controller boundary. Since all database\\nqueries use JPA methods or parameterized queries, SQL injection is further prevented by design.\\nTransport Security: While not explicitly in code, it is implied that the service should be deployed\\nover HTTPS in production to protect JWT and data in transit. JWTs in the header mean CSRF is not an\\nissue, but best practice is to also secure CORS (cross-origin requests) as configured (the README\\nmentions CORS config).\\nRate Limiting & Brute Force: The README mentions configurable rate limiting. This means\\nlogin endpoints can be throttled to prevent brute-force attacks, and booking endpoints can be\\nthrottled to prevent abuse.\\nSecure Config: Sensitive keys (JWT secret, Stripe API keys) are externalized (via environment\\nvariables) to avoid leaking. The JWT secret is not hard-coded but injected from ${JWT_SECRET} in\\nproperties . If secrets were compromised, an attacker could forge tokens or charge payments, so\\nthese must be protected.\\n2 24\\n• 7\\n21\\n• \\n11 25\\n• \\n20\\n• \\n20\\n• 22\\n• \\n26\\n11'),\n",

Mitigation: use a strong secret in production. -\\nThe JwtUtil must always verify the token’s signature and expiration before trusting it. The sequence flow\\nshows this is done. If the code mistakenly used alg=\"none\", that would be a vulnerability – one must\\nensure the token filter rejects unsigned tokens (this is a known JWT security issue).\\n- Token reuse: If a user’s role changes or is deleted, an old JWT might still be valid until expiry. The system\\ndoes not track token revocation, so this is a known trade-off: it assumes trust until expiry. As a mitigation,\\ncritical  role  changes  should  either  wait  out  token  expiration  or  an  additional  mechanism  (e.g.  token\\nblacklist) should be added. - Session hijacking: Since tokens are stored client-side, if an attacker steals a JWT\\n(e.g. by XSS on a malicious front-end), they can impersonate the user . Protecting the front-end (setting\\nsecure cookies, avoiding XSS vulnerabilities) is important. The backend should also set short expiration and\\nconsider refresh tokens if needed. \\nSpring Security Integration\\nSpring Security is tightly integrated: - The WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter (or its modern equivalent)\\ndefines  security  rules,  such  as  .antMatchers(\"/public/**\").permitAll(),  and\\n.anyRequest().authenticated().  It  also  registers  the  JwtRequestFilter before  the\\nauthentication step.\\n- Password encoding uses Spring’s PasswordEncoder (BCrypt).\\n- The use of AuthenticationManager in PublicController is the standard way to delegate login.\\n- CSRF protection is likely disabled for JWT-based APIs (since tokens prevent CSRF anyway).\\n- CORS is configured (per the README) to allow only certain origins to access the API.\\nThese configurations form the security boundary: only authenticated/authorized requests can reach the\\ncontrollers for protected URLs. \\nPrompt Injection (AI) Considerations\\nWhile this project does not embed an LLM, the documentation is prepared for possible AI integration. In the\\ncontext of RAG/AI: - If we allowed users to submit freeform text (e.g. in feedback forms) that was later\\ningested into a language model prompt, care must be taken to sanitize or filter that text to avoid prompt\\ninjection (inserting malicious instructions).\\n- Since endpoints return mainly structured data (JSON bookings, etc.), the risk is low here. However , if any\\nuser  input  is  ever  fed  into  an  AI-driven  chatbot  (for  example,  “Explain  my  booking  history”),  proper\\nsanitization and context constraints are needed.\\n- The code uses validation on all inputs, which also guards against injection of unwanted content. Prompt\\ninjection mostly applies if we take dynamic user content and pass it verbatim to an AI prompt; in any future\\nAI features, we would isolate or encode data to the LLM rather than concatenating raw inputs.\\n14\\n20\\n12'),\n",

Failure & Debugging\\nCommon Failures and Symptoms:\\nDatabase Connection Errors: If MySQL is down or unreachable, the application will fail on startup\\n(unable to validate schema) or throw exceptions on every repository access. Clients would see HTTP\\n500 errors. The logs would show stack traces like DataAccessResourceFailureException. To\\ndebug, check JDBC URL and credentials (in application.properties) and that the DB is\\nrunning.\\nJWT Authentication Failures: A mistyped secret or clock skew could cause token validation to fail.\\nSymptoms: every protected request returns 401. The logs from the JWT filter would mention\\nsignature or expiration issues. Fix by verifying the jwt.secret config (e.g. ${JWT_SECRET}\\nshould match the one used at generation time).\\nValidation Errors: If clients send bad data (e.g. too short password or invalid email), Spring will\\nthrow MethodArgumentNotValidException. Controllers should return a 400 with a message\\n(this should be logged at WARN level). Inspect the validation annotations on DTOs to ensure they\\nmatch the API spec.\\nExternal Service Failures: If Stripe’s API key is missing or wrong (stripe.api.key in config ),\\npayment attempts will fail with Stripe exceptions (logged in the PaymentService). Similarly, email\\nfailures (bad SMTP config) will throw exceptions in the JavaMailSender . Such failures should be\\ncaught and logged – for debugging, verify the SMTP host/port and credentials (the README uses\\nGmail SMTP).\\nConcurrency Issues: Two simultaneous bookings for the same seat may cause one to fail. Typically\\nthis manifests as a constraint violation (e.g. updating a seat that is no longer available). The logs\\nmight show OptimisticLockException or a custom error . To diagnose, enable debug logging\\nfor Hibernate and watch the SQL for seat updates.\\nApplication Crashes: Uncaught exceptions (null pointers, logic bugs) will crash a request thread.\\nSpring Boot by default logs the stacktrace. To debug, ensure the logs capture exceptions, and add\\ntry/catch or additional logging around risky operations (e.g. JSON parsing, API calls).\\nLog Trails and Root-Cause Patterns:\\n- Logs should include a correlation ID or at least include the user ID and booking ID for actions. For\\nexample, when a booking is created, the log might say: “User johndoe (ID 5) booked seat 101, booking\\nID=42.” This helps trace an error back to a user action.\\n- The pattern for debugging is usually: identify the last successful log entry and the first error . For instance,\\nif  booking  fails,  find  logs  from  BookingService.bookSeat(...) and  see  if  a  database  insert  was\\nattempted.\\n- Unexpected values (e.g. negative hours requested) should be caught by validation, but if not, defensive\\nprogramming in services should throw clear exceptions (with logging) to root-cause the issue.\\nPrevention:\\n- Comprehensive unit and integration tests (see next section) help catch regressions.\\n- Code reviews ensure no sensitive data is accidentally logged.\\n- Monitoring tools (like Prometheus/Grafana) can watch for spikes in 500 errors.\\n- Circuit breakers (not currently implemented) could help for repeated Stripe failures. \\n• \\n27\\n• \\n• \\n• 28\\n29\\n• \\n• \\n13'),\n",

Performance & Scaling\\nPotential Bottlenecks:\\n- Database Load: All seat availability checks and booking writes hit MySQL. If many users concurrently book\\nor browse seats, DB contention could rise. Using Redis as a cache for read-heavy operations (e.g. listing\\navailable  seats)  mitigates  this.  Also,  enabling  connection  pooling  (default  in  Spring)  helps  manage  DB\\nconnections efficiently.\\n-  Stripe and Email Latency: Calling external APIs (Stripe, SMTP) introduces latency. By design, payments\\nuse asynchronous webhooks, so the user’s thread waits only for redirect or receipt. Email sending can be\\ndelegated  to  async  tasks.  If  needed,  a  dedicated  messaging  system  (RabbitMQ)  could  be  added,  but\\ncurrently the setup is lightweight.\\n-  PDF Invoice Generation: The application can generate PDF receipts via iText (as noted in docs). On-\\ndemand PDF creation is CPU-bound; if scaled to many users, it could slow responses. A solution is to offload\\nPDF generation to a background task queue or generate them on-the-fly only when requested, caching\\nresults. \\nLoad Expectations:\\n- This application is intended for moderate load (e.g. a single academic library). The monolithic design and\\nsingle MySQL instance suggest expecting hundreds (not millions) of simultaneous users. For high load, we\\nwould  consider  read  replicas  or  a  sharded  DB  and  microservices,  but  for  now  the  expectation  is\\nmanageable with vertical scaling.\\n-  Dockerization  (building  via  docker  build)  and  Docker  Compose  support  suggest  it  is\\nstraightforward to run this app in containerized environments (e.g. Kubernetes, ECS). In production, one\\nwould run multiple containers behind a load balancer . Because the app is stateless (all state in MySQL/\\nRedis), horizontal scaling is feasible. \\nCaching:\\n- Redis is configured (as per the README and tech stack) for caching. A likely use-case is caching seat\\navailability lists or user session data. Proper cache invalidation is needed: e.g. when a booking is made, the\\ncache entry for that seat or for the seat list must be invalidated. The current code may use simple caching\\nannotations (@Cacheable) around repository queries.\\n-  If  not  yet  used  extensively,  enabling  caching  for  read-heavy  queries  (like  findAllSeats or\\nfindUserById) can reduce DB load. We should profile query times and add caching where performance\\nis critical. \\nHorizontal Scaling:\\n- The application is stateless with JWT tokens, so we can run multiple instances of it behind a load balancer .\\nThe only state is in MySQL and Redis, which can be shared across instances. For horizontal scaling, we\\nwould launch more containers/instances of the Spring Boot app (for example, using Docker Compose or\\nKubernetes) and connect them to the same DB/Redis cluster .\\n- MySQL itself could become a bottleneck. In high-scale scenarios, we might migrate MySQL to a managed\\nservice (AWS RDS/Aurora) with read replicas. Redis could be scaled as a cluster .\\n- The Docker support (in README) suggests we can deploy the app as containers in the cloud; nothing in the\\ncode ties it to a single server , so load balancing should be straightforward.\\n18\\n30\\n14'),\n",

Testing Strategy\\nThe README provides commands to run tests (using Maven Wrapper):\\n./mvnw test\\n./mvnw test jacoco:report\\n``` . This implies a test suite exists (likely JUnit tests). Ideally, the \\ntests cover each major component:\\n- **Unit Tests:** For individual services and utilities. For example, tests for \\n`JwtUtil` to ensure token creation and validation works, tests for \\n`BookingService` logic (possibly using mocks for repositories).\\n- **Controller Tests:** Using Spring’s `MockMvc` to simulate HTTP requests and \\nassert responses. For instance, tests for `PublicController` that hit `/signup` \\nor `/login`.\\n- **Integration Tests:** Spinning up an in-memory database (H2) or test \\ncontainer, running the full Spring context to test JPA mappings. For example, \\ninserting a `User` and retrieving via `UserRepository`.\\n**Security Testing:** There should be tests ensuring protected endpoints return \\n401 when no token is provided, and 403 for insufficient roles. Tests could use \\n`@WithMockUser` in Spring to simulate authentication.\\n**Test Gaps:** If the repo’s tests are minimal or missing (not visible), then \\nthis is a noted gap. We would add more coverage for:\\n- Edge cases (e.g. booking beyond available hours, expired subscriptions).\\n- Failure cases (e.g. invalid inputs).\\n- Payment flow simulations (mocking Stripe).\\n- Concurrency (could write multithreaded tests for booking).\\n- Integration of email (mock the `JavaMailSender` to avoid real emails in \\ntests).\\nWe should also include security tests (pen-testing style), but since code is \\nstrictly backend, that may be beyond scope here.\\nIn summary, a strong testing strategy includes unit, integration, and security \\ntests, ideally with Continuous Integration. The README’s mention of \\n`jacoco:report` shows code coverage analysis is supported.\\n## 13. Versioning & Evolution  \\n**Version Control:** The repository currently has no formal releases or version \\ntags (as indicated by “No releases published”). All development is happening \\non `main`. In a production scenario, we would adopt semantic versioning (e.g. \\nv1.0.0) and tag releases.

For instance, changing `POST /booking/seat` to require an extra field \\nwould require a new version or backward compatibility. We should plan such \\nchanges during low-usage windows and notify API consumers (even though this is \\nan internal system, meaning likely only our own front-end uses it).\\n**Future Roadmap (AI Integration):** Since the system is now “LLM-ready,” a \\npotential future is to integrate an AI assistant for library management. For \\nexample:\\n- A chatbot for students to query available seats or subscription status (using \\nRAG on documentation).\\n- AI-driven analytics: ingest usage data (bookings) and have the LLM suggest \\noptimal seat arrangements or identify peak times.\\n- These could involve adding new endpoints or data exports, but importantly they \\nrely on the clear data model we have. \\n- Another future step might be embedding this backend in a broader RAG system – \\ne.g. indexing its docs and schemas into a knowledge base (via LlamaIndex or \\nsimilar) so that an LLM can answer “How do I reserve a study seat?” using the \\nactual code and docs as context.\\n## 14. Interview-Level Explanations  \\n**Explain to a Junior Engineer:**  \\n“iLibrary-Backend is like the back office of a library. Think of it as a \\nrestaurant kitchen: the *Client* (front-end app) places orders (requests) to the \\n*Kitchen* (our Spring Boot server), which cooks up answers. For example, you \\nplace an order “I want to create an account” or “Reserve seat #12 for 2 hours,” \\nand the server checks ingredients (database records) and returns the result. We \\nkeep user data in a database (MySQL), send emails via an SMTP service, and \\nhandle payments through Stripe. The code is organized so that each function \\n(like signup, booking, admin tasks) has its own Java class (Controller), and \\nthose call other classes (Service and Repository) under the hood. We use JWT \\ntokens like restaurant tickets: once you log in, you get a token you show at the \\ndoor to access other services.”\\n**Explain to a Senior Engineer:**  \\n“iLibrary is a modular Spring Boot monolith designed for clarity and \\nmaintainability. We have layered architecture: controllers handle REST \\nendpoints, services implement domain logic, and Spring Data repositories handle \\npersistence to a MySQL schema. Authentication is stateless JWT with roles \\nenforced via Spring Security (ROLE_USER vs ROLE_ADMIN). We have endpoints for \\nbooking, subscriptions (Stripe integration), and admin reporting.

The codebase is well-documented (Swagger UI, diagrams, \\ncode comments) to facilitate easy onboarding. In a team, we’d continue adding \\nunit/integration tests, use CI/CD to enforce quality, and may eventually \\nconsider splitting services if the load grows substantially.”\\n**Explain to an AI/LLM Engineer:**  \\n“From an LLM perspective, the iLibrary codebase is structured with clear domain \\nlanguage and docs, making it a good candidate for knowledge extraction. We can \\nindex the README, class and method names, and API docs to build a retrieval \\ndatabase. For example, if we ask a future assistant “How do I cancel a seat \\nbooking?”, it could retrieve the `/booking/cancel` endpoint definition and even \\nreference the sequence diagram (QR code flow) for context. The system’s \\nconsistent use of terms (User, Booking, Subscription) and layered architecture \\nmakes fine-tuning a model on this code feasible. Essentially, each API endpoint \\nand data model can become a “document” in an embedding store. Then an LLM can \\nanswer queries by combining this factual base with generative capabilities, \\nreducing hallucinations. Our design choices (monolithic, straightforward \\nschema, JSON schemas) also help ensure the data is well-aligned and minimal \\nconfounding jargon for training.”\\n**Common Q&A:**  \\n- *Why not use microservices?* Because the domain is not large enough to justify \\nthe complexity. A monolith lets us develop and deploy faster. We can always \\nbreak it later if needed.  \\n- *Why JWT instead of sessions?* JWT keeps the app stateless and allows \\nhorizontal scaling (no session store needed). It’s standard for modern REST APIs \\n(and the README specifically calls it “Secure token-based authentication”).  \\n- *What about concurrency on bookings?* We rely on transactional DB updates. In \\ncase of a race, the DB will block one transaction (or throw an exception) and we \\nhandle that by retrying or telling the user the seat is no longer available. For \\na single-library use-case, this has been adequate.  \\n- *Why MySQL vs NoSQL?* We needed relational constraints (like linking bookings \\nto users and seats). SQL is simpler for these one-to-many relationships, and \\nwe benefit from transactions. A NoSQL store would complicate queries.  \\n- *How to handle failures?* We log errors and return proper HTTP codes. For \\nexample, if payment fails, we log the webhook payload and update the booking \\nstatus to FAILED, allowing retry. Unit and integration tests cover most \\nscenarios.

It is intended for software engineers, architects, and technical \\nmanagers involved in the development, maintenance, and scaling of this service. Its goal is \\nto be the single source of truth, enabling a new engineer to understand, build, and debug \\nthe system from the ground up. \\n \\n--- \\n \\n## 1. Executive Overview \\n \\n### 1.1. Problem(s) This System Solves \\nThe `iLibrary-Backend` system is designed to solve the core operational challenges of \\nmanaging a private, physical study library. In traditional library settings, key activities are \\noften manual, inefficient, and lack real-time visibility. This system digitizes and automates \\nthese processes. \\n \\nThe primary problems solved are: \\n- Inefficient Seat Management: Students struggle to find available seats, and administrators \\nhave no real-time view of occupancy. This leads to wasted time for students and \\nunderutilization of library space. \\n- Manual User & Subscription Handling: Onboarding new members, managing subscription \\npayments, and enforcing access rights based on subscription status is often a paper-based or \\nspreadsheet-driven process, prone to errors and administrative overhead.'),\n",

Why These Projects Were Combined \\nThis repository, while appearing as a single `iLibrary-Backend` project, implicitly integrates \\nseveral logical \"sub-projects\" or domains into a cohesive monolith: \\n \\n1.  Identity & Access Management (IAM): Handles user registration, authentication (JWT), \\nand role-based authorization. This is the security foundation. \\n2.  Subscription & Billing Management: Manages user subscription tiers, status \\n(active/inactive), and validity. This is the core business logic. \\n3.  Seat & Booking Management: The primary operational component, handling seat \\ninventory, real-time booking, check-in/check-out, and availability tracking. \\n4.  Automated System Operations: A scheduling module responsible for automated tasks like \\nreleasing abandoned seats, which ensures resource fairness. \\n \\nThese components were combined into a single monolithic backend for several strategic \\nreasons: \\n-   Tight Coupling of Business Logic: The core workflows are intrinsically linked. For example, \\nbooking a seat (`Booking Management`) requires checking if the user is authenticated \\n(`IAM`) and has an active subscription (`Subscription Management`). Separating these into \\nmicroservices would introduce significant network overhead and complexity in maintaining \\ndata consistency across services. \\n-   Simplified Development & Deployment: For a project of this scale, a monolith offers a \\nfaster development cycle. A single codebase, a single build process, and a single deployment \\nartifact (the JAR file) dramatically reduce operational complexity compared to managing a \\ndistributed system.'),\n",

For example, \\na user's check-in must atomically update the seat's status and the booking record. A single \\ndatabase backing a monolithic application makes it trivial to enforce these ACID properties. \\n-   Early-Stage Project: For a new product or a small team, a monolith is the pragmatic choice \\nto achieve a rapid time-to-market. The architectural overhead of microservices would have \\nslowed down initial development without providing proportional benefits. \\n \\n### 1.3.

API Layer: The entry point is the `Controller` layer, which exposes HTTP endpoints. It uses \\nData Transfer Objects (DTOs) to define the API contract, decoupling the API from the internal \\ndatabase structure. \\n3.  Security Layer: Every request first passes through the Spring Security filter chain. For \\nprotected endpoints, the `JwtAuthenticationFilter` intercepts the request, validates the JWT \\ntoken from the `Authorization` header, and establishes the user\\'s security context. \\n4.  Business Logic Layer: The `Service` layer contains the core application logic. Controllers \\ndelegate calls to these services (e.g., `BookingService`, `UserService`). This layer orchestrates \\ncalls to the data access layer and implements the complex business rules. \\n5.  Data Access Layer: This layer is responsible for all database interactions. It consists of JPA \\n`Entity` classes that map to database tables and `Repository` interfaces (Spring Data JPA) \\nthat provide CRUD operations and custom queries. \\n6.  Database: A MySQL database (recommended to be hosted on AWS RDS for production) \\npersists all application state: users, seats, bookings, subscriptions, etc. \\n7.  External Integrations: The system integrates with an email service (via JavaMail) to send \\nnotifications, such as booking confirmations.

Non-Goals and Intentional Trade-offs \\n \\n-   Not a Real-time Collaborative System: The system is not designed for Google Docs-style \\nreal-time updates. Seat availability is \"near real-time.\" There\\'s an accepted, small window of \\ninconsistency where two users might attempt to book the same seat simultaneously \\n(handled by database constraints). \\n-   No Social Features: This is a utility-focused application. Features like user profiles, \\nmessaging, or friend lists are intentionally excluded to keep the scope tight. \\n-   Billing/Payment Gateway is Out of Scope: The system manages `Subscription` status but \\ndoes not integrate with a payment processor like Stripe. It\\'s assumed that subscription \\nstatus is updated via an administrative process or a separate, future integration. This was a \\ncritical trade-off to simplify the initial build. \\n-   Single-Tenancy: The system is designed for a single library. It is not a multi-tenant SaaS \\nplatform. All data (users, seats) coexists within a single database schema. \\n-   Trade-off: Monolith vs. Microservices: The choice of a monolith was a conscious trade-off \\nof future scalability for initial development speed and simplicity.

It's not a cryptographically signed, single-use token. This was a \\ntrade-off for implementation simplicity, accepting a minor security risk that a user could \\ntheoretically guess a valid booking ID (mitigated by using UUIDs for booking IDs). \\n \\n--- \\n \\n## 2. System Architecture (Very Deep) \\n \\n### 2.1. Monolith vs Microservices Reasoning \\nAs stated in the overview, the monolithic architecture was a deliberate choice. Let's dive \\ndeeper into the reasoning. \\n \\nArguments for the Monolithic Choice: \\n \\n1.  Transactional Simplicity: The core workflow `(User -> attempts to book Seat)` requires an \\natomic check: \\n    -   Is the User authenticated? \\n    -   Does the User have an active Subscription? \\n    -   Is the Seat available? \\n    -   Is the User already checked into another seat? \\n    In a monolith, this can be wrapped in a single `@Transactional` method, guaranteeing that \\nthe booking is created and the seat status is updated atomically. If any step fails, the entire \\ntransaction is rolled back. \\n    In a microservices architecture, this would require complex distributed transaction \\npatterns like Saga or 2-Phase Commit, introducing immense complexity and potential for \\ndata inconsistency.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'producer': 'Microsoft® Word 2021', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2021', 'creationdate': '2026-01-09T20:27:51+05:30', 'author': 'Himanshu Raturi', 'moddate': '2026-01-09T20:27:51+05:30', 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\raw\\\\Internal Knowledge Base - iLibrary Backend.pdf', 'total_pages': 58, 'page': 6, 'page_label': '7'}, page_content='2.  Low Operational Overhead: A single Git repository, a single build pipeline (e.g., `mvn \\nclean install`), a single artifact to deploy (the JAR), and a single service to monitor. For a \\nsmall team or a single developer, this is manageable. A microservices approach would \\nrequire a service discovery mechanism, a centralized configuration server, an API gateway, \\nand a much more complex CI/CD and monitoring setup. \\n \\n3.  Performance: For tightly coupled workflows, in-process method calls within a monolith \\nare orders of magnitude faster and more reliable than inter-service network calls in a \\nmicroservices architecture. The latency introduced by network hops between an \"Auth \\nService,\" a \"Subscription Service,\" and a \"Booking Service\" would be noticeable and \\ndetrimental to the user experience. \\n \\n4.  Refactoring and Code Sharing: It\\'s easy to refactor code and share common modules (like \\nthe `exception` or `dto` packages) across the application. In microservices, this would require \\npublishing shared libraries or duplicating code, both of which have their own maintenance \\nchallenges. \\n \\nThe system is not yet at a scale where the typical drivers for microservices (team autonomy, \\nindependent scaling of components, technology heterogeneity) provide a compelling benefit \\nthat outweighs this added complexity. \\n \\n### 2.2. Component Interaction Flow \\nLet\\'s trace a critical user journey: A user successfully books a seat and checks in. \\n \\n1.  Authentication: \\n    -   User logs in with credentials. \\n    -   `POST /auth/login` hits `AuthController`. \\n    -   `AuthController` calls `AuthenticationManager` (Spring Security). \\n    -   `UserDetailsService` implementation (`UserInfoService`) loads the user from the DB. \\n    -   If credentials are valid, `JwtService` generates a JWT token. \\n    -   Token is returned to the client.'),\n",

Booking a Seat: \\n    -   User (now with a valid JWT) requests to book a seat. \\n    -   `POST /bookings/book/{seatId}` hits `BookingController`. \\n    -   The request first passes through `JwtAuthenticationFilter`. The filter validates the JWT, \\nextracts the user's identity, and populates the `SecurityContextHolder`. The request is now \\nauthenticated. \\n    -   `BookingController` method is invoked. It extracts `seatId` from the path and the user's \\nidentity from the `SecurityContext`. \\n    -   `BookingController` calls `bookingService.createBooking(seatId, userDetails)`. \\n    -   Inside `BookingService.createBooking` (a `@Transactional` method): \\n        a.

Sync vs. Async Decisions \\n \\n-   Primarily Synchronous: The vast majority of the system's operations are synchronous. \\nUser-facing actions like logging in, booking a seat, or checking availability require an \\nimmediate response. The request-response cycle is blocking, which is the standard and \\nsimplest model for such operations. \\n \\n-   Asynchronous Operations: \\n    1.  Email Notifications: While not explicitly implemented in the provided code, sending an \\nemail confirmation after a booking is a classic candidate for async execution. If done \\nsynchronously, an SMTP server delay would increase the API response time. The ideal \\nimplementation would be: \\n        -   The `BookingService` completes the booking transaction. \\n        -   It publishes a `BookingConfirmedEvent`. \\n        -   An `@Async` or `@EventListener` component listens for this event and handles the \\nemail sending in a separate thread. This way, the user's API call returns instantly, and the \\nemail is sent in the background.\"),\n",

Processing (Inside the Application): \\n    -   Controller: Jackson library deserializes the JSON payload into a `User` object (which is \\nbeing used as a DTO here, a slight anti-pattern). The `@RequestBody User user` parameter in \\n`AuthController.addUser` is populated. \\n    -   Service: The `User` object is passed to `userService.addUser(user)`. Inside this service: \\n        -   The raw password (`\"strongpassword123\"`) is extracted.'),\n",

Backend (Spring Boot / API Layer) \\n \\n### 4.1. Controller Design Philosophy \\nThe controller layer in `iLibrary-Backend` is designed to be a thin, clean, and focused entry \\npoint into the system. The philosophy is as follows: \\n \\n-   Responsibility Separation: Controllers are strictly responsible for handling HTTP-specific \\nconcerns. This includes: \\n    -   Mapping endpoints (`@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`). \\n    -   Extracting data from the request (path variables, request bodies, parameters). \\n    -   Invoking the appropriate service layer method. \\n    -   Returning a `ResponseEntity` with the correct HTTP status code and body. \\n-   No Business Logic: Controllers contain zero business logic. All decision-making, data \\nmanipulation, and orchestration are delegated to the `Service` layer. A controller method \\nshould ideally be a one-line call to a service. This makes the code easier to test and reason \\nabout, as the web layer is decoupled from the core rules of the application. \\n-   Statelessness: The controllers are stateless, in line with REST principles. Each API request \\ncontains all the information needed to process it. The server does not store any client \\nsession state between requests. State is managed via JWTs for authentication and persisted \\nin the database. \\n-   DTO-Centric (Aspirational): The ideal design, and one the project partially follows, is to use \\nData Transfer Objects (DTOs) for all request and response bodies. This decouples the API's \\npublic contract from the internal database schema (`Entity`). \\n    -   Benefit: If you need to refactor an `Entity` (e.g., rename a column), you don't break the \\npublic API. You simply adjust the mapping between the DTO and the Entity. \\n    -   Current State: The project sometimes passes JPA `Entity` objects directly to and from \\ncontrollers (`@RequestBody User user`). While this is faster to implement, it's a technical \\ndebt. It tightly couples the API to the database structure and can lead to bugs, such as \\ninadvertently exposing sensitive fields (like a password hash) or creating complex object \\ngraphs that Jackson (the JSON serializer) struggles with.\"),\n",

DTO vs Entity Separation \\n-   Entity (`com.studylibrary.entity`): \\n    -   Represents the database schema. \\n    -   Contains JPA annotations (`@Entity`, `@Id`, `@ManyToOne`, etc.). \\n    -   Represents the internal, canonical data model. \\n    -   Managed by the persistence context (Hibernate). \\n-   DTO (Data Transfer Object): \\n    -   Represents the API contract. \\n    -   A simple POJO (Plain Old Java Object) with fields, getters, and setters. \\n    -   Contains no persistence annotations. \\n    -   Used in `@RequestBody` and `ResponseEntity` in the `Controller` layer. \\n    -   Example: A `UserDTO` would be created to avoid exposing the `password` field in API \\nresponses. \\n        ```java \\n        // In User Entity \\n        @Entity \\n        public class User { \\n            @Id private Long id; \\n            private String email; \\n            @JsonIgnore // Important but easily forgotten \\n            private String password; \\n            // ... \\n        } \\n \\n        // Better: Use a DTO \\n        public class UserResponseDTO { \\n            private Long id; \\n            private String email;'),\n",

Validation Strategy \\nThe system uses Bean Validation (`javax.validation`), a standard Java specification, integrated \\nseamlessly with Spring Boot. \\n \\n-   How it Works: \\n    1.  Annotations on Entities/DTOs: Constraints are declared directly on the fields of the \\nmodel classes using annotations like `@NotNull`, `@Email`, `@Size`, `@Pattern`. \\n    2.  Triggering Validation: The `@Valid` annotation is placed on the `@RequestBody` \\nparameter in a controller method. \\n    3.  Execution: When a request arrives, before the controller method is executed, Spring \\nautomatically invokes the validator on the deserialized object. \\n    4.  Failure Handling: If validation fails, a `MethodArgumentNotValidException` is thrown. \\nThis exception is caught by our `RestResponseEntityExceptionHandler`, which formats a \\nuser-friendly `400 Bad Request` response detailing the errors. \\n \\n-   Example: \\n    ```java \\n    // In User entity or a UserRegistrationDTO \\n    public class UserRegistrationDTO { \\n        @NotNull(message = \"Name cannot be null\") \\n        @Size(min = 2, message = \"Name must be at least 2 characters\") \\n        private String name; \\n \\n        @NotNull(message = \"Email cannot be null\") \\n        @Email(message = \"Please provide a valid email address\")'),\n",

Security Boundaries \\nThe primary security boundary is the API gateway, enforced by Spring Security. \\n-   Public Endpoints: A few endpoints are explicitly marked as public. These are necessary for \\nnew users to join or for existing users to log in. \\n    -   `POST /auth/register` \\n    -   `POST /auth/login` \\n-   Protected Endpoints: All other endpoints are protected by default. Accessing them \\nrequires a valid JWT sent in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. This includes all \\nendpoints related to booking, checking seat status, managing user profiles, etc. \\n-   Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): The system implements two roles: `ROLE_USER` and \\n`ROLE_ADMIN`. This is enforced using Spring Security\\'s annotations. \\n    -   `@PreAuthorize(\"hasRole(\\'ADMIN\\')\")`: This annotation on a controller method ensures \\nthat only users with the `ROLE_ADMIN` claim in their JWT can execute it.

Authentication: Spring Security\\'s `AuthenticationManager` uses the custom \\n`UserInfoService` to load the user\\'s details (including the hashed password) from the \\ndatabase. It compares the provided password with the stored hash. \\n3.  Token Generation: If authentication is successful, the `AuthController` calls \\n`jwtService.generateToken(username)`. \\n4.  Inside `JwtService.generateToken`: \\n    a.  It defines the claims for the JWT.

Failing to do \\nthis would allow User A to check out User B's booking. \\n-   Rule: An `ADMIN` can view all bookings, but a `USER` can only view their own. \\n    -   Implementation: The `GET /bookings` endpoint would have two different logic paths \\nbased on the user's role. If the user has `ROLE_ADMIN`, the service returns \\n`bookingRepository.findAll()`. If they have `ROLE_USER`, it returns \\n`bookingRepository.findByUserId(currentUserId)`. \\n-   Edge Case: What if an admin's role is revoked while they have an active session? The JWT \\nthey hold is still valid until it expires, and it still contains the `ROLE_ADMIN` claim. This is a \\nclassic stateless token problem. \\n    -   Mitigation 1 (Simple): Keep token expiration times short (e.g., 15-30 minutes). \\n    -   Mitigation 2 (Complex): Implement a token blocklist. When a user's roles change, their \\ntoken ID (`jti` claim) is added to a blocklist in a fast-access store like Redis. The \\n`JwtAuthenticationFilter` would need to check this blocklist on every request, which \\nsacrifices the pure statelessness of JWTs but provides immediate revocation. This system \\ndoes not implement this, trading immediate revocation for simplicity. \\n \\n--- \\n \\n## 5. Database Layer \\n \\n### 5.1.

This is a strong candidate for an index. However, since the cardinality \\nis low (only a few distinct statuses), the database\\'s query planner might sometimes opt for a \\nfull table scan anyway. \\n-   `booking.status` and `booking.check_in_time`: The `SeatReleaseScheduler` needs to find \\nbookings that are `CONFIRMED` and older than a certain time, or `CHECKED_IN` and older \\nthan a certain time. A composite index on `(status, check_in_time)` would be highly effective \\nfor this background job. \\n \\n### 5.3. Relationships and Constraints \\n-   `@OneToOne(mappedBy = \"user\")` in `User` and `@OneToOne @JoinColumn(name = \\n\"user_id\")` in `Subscription`: This enforces that one user can have only one subscription \\nrecord. \\n-   `@ManyToOne` in `Booking`: Links a booking to a single user and a single seat. \\n-   `@OneToMany(mappedBy = \"user\")` in `User`: Allows navigating from a `User` to all of \\ntheir `Booking`s. The `mappedBy` attribute indicates that the `Booking` entity is the owner \\nof the relationship (where the foreign key column is). \\n-   Database-level Constraints: Unique constraints on `user.email` and `seat.seat_number` are \\ncritical for data integrity, preventing duplicate records even if the application logic fails. \\nForeign key constraints (`ON DELETE RESTRICT` by default) prevent orphaned records, e.g., \\nyou cannot delete a `User` if they still have `Booking`s. \\n \\n### 5.4.

This is why it's good practice to use custom runtime exceptions (like \\n`SeatNotAvailableException`) to signal business failures that should trigger a rollback. \\n \\n### 5.5. Failure Scenarios (Partial Writes, Retries) \\n-   Partial Writes: \\n    -   Scenario: Imagine `createBooking` was not transactional. The code saves the new \\n`Booking` record, but before it can update the `Seat` status, the server crashes. The result is \\nan inconsistent state: a booking exists for a seat that is still marked as `AVAILABLE`. \\n    -   Prevention: `@Transactional` prevents this entirely. The database changes are not made \\npermanent (`COMMIT`) until the method completes successfully. If an error occurs at any \\npoint, the transaction is rolled back, and the database is left untouched. \\n-   Retries: \\n    -   Scenario: A `PessimisticLockingFailureException` or \\n`DeadlockLoserDataAccessException` can occur in high-concurrency scenarios. For example, \\ntwo transactions deadlocking each other while trying to acquire locks on seats. \\n    -   Strategy: This system does not have an explicit retry mechanism. The exception would \\npropagate up and result in a `500` or `409` error.

It would add significant \\ncomplexity, cost, and non-determinism for no clear benefit.

Backend (Spring Boot / API Layer) \\n \\n### 4.1. Controller Design Philosophy \\nThe controllers in this application follow a resource-oriented design, which is a core tenet of \\nRESTful web services. Each controller manages a specific domain or resource. \\n \\n-   `AuthController`: Manages the non-resource-specific actions of authentication and user \\nregistration. Its endpoints (`/auth/login`, `/auth/register`) are the public gateways to the \\nsystem. \\n-   `BookingController`: Manages the `Booking` resource. It handles state changes related to \\na user\\'s booking lifecycle (create, check-in, check-out). \\n-   `SeatController`: Manages the `Seat` resource. It is primarily used for querying seat status \\nand availability, which is a read-heavy operation. \\n-   `SubscriptionController`: Manages the `Subscription` resource, handling its creation and \\nstatus checks. \\n \\nKey Principles Followed: \\n1.  Statelessness: The API is stateless. Every request from a client must contain all the \\ninformation needed to be understood and processed. The server does not store any session \\nstate between requests. The user\\'s authenticated state is carried in the JWT token. \\n2.  Thin Controllers: The controllers are intentionally \"thin.\" Their sole responsibility is to \\nhandle HTTP-specific tasks: parsing request bodies, extracting path variables and'),\n",

They \\ncontain no business logic. \\n3.  Uniform Interface: The API uses standard HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`) to \\nmanipulate resources, and standard HTTP status codes (`200 OK`, `201 Created`, `400 Bad \\nRequest`, `401 Unauthorized`, `404 Not Found`, `409 Conflict`) to communicate outcomes. \\n \\n### 4.2. DTO vs. Entity Separation \\nA critical architectural principle is the separation of Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) from JPA \\nEntities. \\n \\n-   Entities (`@Entity`): These represent the database schema. They are managed by the \\npersistence context and can be lazily loaded, which can cause issues if they are directly \\nserialized and sent over the network. Exposing entities directly can also leak internal \\ndatabase structure and create security vulnerabilities (e.g., accidentally exposing a user\\'s \\npassword hash). \\n-   DTOs (Plain Old Java Objects - POJOs): These are objects that define the \"shape\" of the \\ndata for the API. They are dumb data carriers with no behavior. \\n \\nCurrent Implementation & Refinement: \\nThe current `iLibrary-Backend` project sometimes uses entities directly in the controller layer \\n(e.g., taking a `User` entity in the registration endpoint). While this is convenient for small \\nprojects, it\\'s an anti-pattern that should be corrected. \\n \\nRecommended (Ideal) Flow: \\n1.  Request: A `POST` request with a `CreateUserRequestDTO` in its body hits the \\n`AuthController`. \\n2.  Controller: The controller receives the `CreateUserRequestDTO`. \\n3.  Mapping: The controller (or a dedicated `Mapper` service) converts the \\n`CreateUserRequestDTO` into a `User` entity. \\n4.  Service: The `User` entity is passed to the `UserService`. \\n5.  Response: The `UserService` returns a saved `User` entity. This is then mapped to a \\n`UserResponseDTO` (which would exclude sensitive fields like the password) before being \\nsent back in the HTTP response.'),\n",

Validation Strategy \\nInput validation is implemented at the boundary of the system—the controller layer—to \\nensure data integrity before any business logic is executed. The project uses the Bean \\nValidation API (via `spring-boot-starter-validation`). \\n \\nHow it Works: \\n-   Annotations: Constraints are declared directly on the fields of the DTOs (or entities, in the \\ncurrent implementation) using annotations like `@NotNull`, `@Email`, `@Size`, and \\n`@NotBlank`. \\n-   Triggering: The `@Valid` annotation is used on controller method parameters (e.g., \\n`@PostMapping(\"/register\") public String addUser(@RequestBody @Valid User user)`). This \\ntells Spring to trigger the validation process. \\n-   Exception Handling: If validation fails, a `MethodArgumentNotValidException` (for \\n`@RequestBody`) or `ConstraintViolationException` is thrown. This is caught by the \\n`RestResponseEntityExceptionHandler`, which formats a `400 Bad Request` response with a \\nclear, structured error message detailing which fields are invalid and why. This prevents \\ninvalid data from ever reaching the service layer. \\n \\n### 4.4. Security Boundaries \\nThe primary security boundary is managed by Spring Security. The configuration (in a class \\nlike `SecurityConfig`) defines which parts of the API are public and which are protected. \\n \\n-   Public Boundary: Endpoints like `/auth/login`, `/auth/register`, and perhaps `GET \\n/seats/availability` are configured to be `permitAll()`. These can be accessed by any client \\nwithout authentication. \\n-   Protected Boundary: All other endpoints, especially those that create or modify data (e.g., \\n`POST /bookings/book/`, `POST /admin/`), are protected. The configuration requires a valid, \\nauthenticated user (`.anyRequest().authenticated()`). Access is only granted if the \\n`JwtAuthenticationFilter` successfully validates a JWT from the request.'),\n",

For example: \\n    ```java \\n    .requestMatchers(\"/admin/\").hasRole(\"ADMIN\") \\n    .requestMatchers(\"/bookings/\").hasAnyRole(\"USER\", \"ADMIN\") \\n    ``` \\n    This ensures that only users with the `ROLE_ADMIN` (as defined in their `User` entity) can \\naccess administrative endpoints. \\n \\n### 4.5. JWT Authentication Flow (Step-by-Step) \\n1.  User Login: The user sends their email and password to `POST /auth/login`. \\n2.  Authentication: Spring Security\\'s `AuthenticationManager` uses the custom \\n`UserInfoService` to load the user from the database by email and compares the provided \\npassword with the stored bcrypt hash. \\n3.  Token Generation: If authentication is successful, the `AuthController` calls the \\n`JwtService.generateToken()` method. \\n    -   Inside `JwtService`, a new JWT is built. \\n    -   Claims: The token\\'s payload (claims) is populated with essential, non-sensitive user \\ninformation: `sub` (subject, usually the email/username), `roles` (the user\\'s roles), `iat` \\n(issued at), and `exp` (expiration time). \\n    -   Signing: The token header and payload are encoded, combined, and then signed using a \\nsecret key (e.g., HMAC-SHA256). This signature ensures the token\\'s integrity; any \\nmodification will invalidate it. \\n4.  Token Issuance: The signed JWT string is returned to the user in the login response body. \\n5.  Token Storage (Client-Side): The client application (web or mobile) stores this token \\nsecurely (e.g., in `localStorage` for a web app, though `HttpOnly` cookies are safer against \\nXSS). \\n6.  Subsequent Requests: For every subsequent request to a protected endpoint, the client \\nincludes the JWT in the `Authorization` header: `Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>`. \\n7.  Token Validation (Filter): The `JwtAuthenticationFilter` intercepts the request. \\n    -   It extracts the token from the header. \\n    -   It calls `JwtService` to parse and validate the token.

Security Context Population: If the token is valid, the filter extracts the user\\'s identity \\n(`sub` and `roles` claims), creates an `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` object \\nrepresenting the authenticated user, and sets it in the `SecurityContextHolder`. \\n9.  Access Granted: The request proceeds to the controller. Downstream logic can now \\naccess the authenticated user\\'s details via the `SecurityContext`. \\n \\n### 4.6. Authorization Rules and Edge Cases \\n-   Standard Rules: Users can only manage their own resources. For example, in \\n`BookingService.checkOut(bookingId)`, there should be a check: `if \\n(!booking.getUser().getId().equals(currentUser.getId())) { throw new \\nUnauthorizedAccessException(); }`.

These carry semantic meaning. \\n-   Centralized Handler: The `@ControllerAdvice` class has multiple `@ExceptionHandler` \\nmethods, each one tailored to a specific exception type. \\n    -   `handleBookingNotFound(BookingNotFoundException ex)` returns a `4_04 Not Found`. \\n    -   `handleSeatNotAvailable(SeatNotAvailableException ex)` returns a `409 Conflict`. \\n    -   `handleConstraintViolationException(...)` returns a `400 Bad Request`. \\n-   Benefit: This keeps the controller and service code clean and focused on the \"happy path\" \\nlogic.

Database Layer \\n \\n### 5.1. Schema Design Rationale \\nThe database schema is designed around the core entities of the library system. It\\'s a \\nrelational model that balances normalization with query performance. \\n \\nTables (Inferred from Entities): \\n-   `users`: Stores user information (`id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `roles`). \\n    -   `email` has a `UNIQUE` constraint to prevent duplicate accounts. \\n-   `subscriptions`: Stores subscription details for each user.'),\n",

A `@OneToOne` to the current active subscription is \\ncommon. \\n-   `seats`: Represents the physical seats in the library. \\n    -   `id`, `seat_number`, `status` (`AVAILABLE`, `BOOKED`, `OCCUPIED`, `MAINTENANCE`). \\n    -   `seat_number` should have a `UNIQUE` constraint. \\n-   `bookings`: An associative table that links users and seats for a specific time. \\n    -   `id` (UUID is a good choice), `user_id` (FK to `users`), `seat_id` (FK to `seats`), \\n`booking_time`, `check_in_time`, `check_out_time`, `status` (`CONFIRMED`, `CHECKED_IN`, \\n`COMPLETED`, `EXPIRED`). \\n \\nRationale: \\n-   Normalization: User and seat information is stored separately to avoid redundancy. A \\n`bookings` table then records the relationship between them, which is a standard \\nnormalized design. \\n-   Status Enums: Using `ENUM` types or `String` representations for status fields \\n(`SeatStatus`, `BookingStatus`) makes application logic clear and prevents invalid state \\nvalues. \\n-   Timestamps: `booking_time`, `check_in_time`, etc., are crucial for the system's logic, \\nespecially the automated seat release scheduler. `created_at` and `updated_at` columns \\n(often handled by `@CreationTimestamp` and `@UpdateTimestamp`) are vital for auditing. \\n \\n### 5.2. Indexing Decisions \\nProper indexing is the most critical factor for database performance. \\n \\n-   Primary Keys (`id`): Automatically indexed. All `findById` lookups are fast. \\n-   Foreign Keys (`user_id`, `seat_id`): Spring Data JPA/Hibernate typically creates indexes on \\nforeign key columns. This is essential for efficient `JOIN` operations (e.g., finding all bookings \\nfor a user). \\n-   Query-Driven Indexes: Indexes must be added based on common query patterns.\"),\n",

AND status IN (\\'CONFIRMED\\', \\n\\'CHECKED_IN\\')`). \\n    -   `bookings(status, booking_time)`: A composite index on `(status, booking_time)` is \\nessential for the `SeatReleaseScheduler`, which needs to efficiently find all bookings that are \\n`CONFIRMED` and older than a certain threshold. \\n \\n### 5.3. Relationships and Constraints \\n-   `User` to `Subscription`: `@OneToMany`. A user can have multiple subscriptions over time \\n(a history). Or, `@OneToOne` if only the current one matters. The foreign key is in the \\n`subscriptions` table. \\n-   `User` to `Booking`: `@OneToMany`. A user can make many bookings. The foreign key \\n(`user_id`) is in the `bookings` table. \\n-   `Seat` to `Booking`: `@OneToMany`. A seat can be part of many bookings over time. The \\nforeign key (`seat_id`) is in the `bookings` table. \\n-   Constraints: \\n    -   `NOT NULL`: Most foreign key and status columns should be non-nullable. \\n    -   `UNIQUE`: `users.email`, `seats.seat_number`. \\n    -   Cascading: Cascade types should be used carefully. `CascadeType.ALL` from `User` to \\n`Booking` would be dangerous—deleting a user would delete all their past booking history. \\n`CascadeType.PERSIST` and `CascadeType.MERGE` are often safer. Deleting a user should \\nprobably be a \"soft delete\" (setting an `is_active` flag to `false`) to preserve historical data \\nintegrity. \\n \\n### 5.4.

It must create a \\n`Booking` row AND update a `Seat` row. `@Transactional` ensures that if the seat update \\nfails for any reason, the booking creation is rolled back, preventing an inconsistent state (a \\nbooking for a seat that still shows as available). \\n    -   `BookingService.checkIn()`: Updates both the `Booking` and `Seat` status. \\n-   Read-Only Transactions: Methods that only read data (e.g., \\n`seatService.findAvailableSeats()`) can be marked with `@Transactional(readOnly = true)`. \\nThis provides a performance hint to the persistence provider and the database, which can \\napply certain optimizations. \\n \\n### 5.5. Failure Scenarios (Data Layer) \\n-   Race Condition (Booking): Two users request `POST /bookings/book/101` for the last seat \\nat the same time. \\n    -   Without Locking: Both threads could read the seat status as `AVAILABLE`, both create a \\nbooking, and the last one to write wins. The first user thinks they have a booking, but the \\nseat status is updated by the second user. This is a classic race condition. \\n    -   Mitigation (Pessimistic Locking): The `BookingService` should use \\n`seatRepository.findByIdPessimistic(...)` or an equivalent \\n`@Lock(LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_WRITE)` annotation. The first transaction to read the \\nseat places a database-level lock on the row. The second transaction will block until the first \\none commits or rolls back, at which point it will read the (now `BOOKED`) status and fail \\ncleanly. \\n    -   Mitigation (Optimistic Locking): Add a `@Version` column to the `Seat` entity. When \\nupdating the seat, the `UPDATE` statement includes a `WHERE version = ?` clause. If another \\ntransaction has already updated the seat (and incremented its version), the `UPDATE` will \\naffect 0 rows, and Hibernate will throw an `OptimisticLockException`, which can be handled \\nto inform the user to try again. Pessimistic locking is often simpler and more appropriate for \\nhigh-contention resources like seats. \\n-   Partial Writes: This is exactly what `@Transactional` prevents. Without it, if the \\n`bookingRepository.save()` succeeded but the `seatRepository.save()` failed (e.g., due to a \\nbrief network issue), the database would be left in an inconsistent state.\"),\n",

Data Consistency Guarantees \\n-   Strong Consistency: Within the monolith, the system guarantees strong consistency for all \\noperations, thanks to the ACID properties of the single relational database and the use of \\ntransactions.

Bottlenecks \\n-   Database: The database is the most likely bottleneck for any transactional application. \\n    -   Unindexed Queries: A single frequently-run query without a proper index (like checking \\nseat availability) can bring the entire system to its knees under load by causing full table \\nscans. \\n    -   Connection Pool Exhaustion: If transactions are too long or there are too many \\nconcurrent requests, the application can run out of available database connections. \\n-   Application CPU: For a simple CRUD application like this, the CPU is less likely to be the \\nbottleneck unless there is a very high volume of requests causing constant \\nserialization/deserialization and request processing overhead. \\n-   Single Point of Failure: The monolithic application instance is a single point of failure. If the \\nprocess crashes, the entire service is down.\"),\n",

Load Behavior \\n-   Read-Heavy: The system is likely to be read-heavy. Many users will be checking seat \\navailability (`GET /seats/availability`) for every one user who successfully books a seat (`POST \\n/bookings/book`). \\n-   Spiky Traffic: Load will be spiky, concentrated around peak hours (e.g., lunchtimes, \\nevenings, exam periods). The system needs to handle these bursts. \\n \\n### 11.3. Caching Strategy \\nCaching is crucial for handling the read-heavy load. \\n \\n-   Level 1: Local Cache (In-Memory) \\n    -   Candidate: `GET /seats/availability`. The list of available seats changes, but not \\nnecessarily every second. \\n    -   Implementation: Use Spring\\'s `@Cacheable(\"availableSeats\")` annotation on the \\n`seatService.findAvailableSeats()` method. Configure a short TTL (Time To Live), e.g., 5-10 \\nseconds. \\n    -   Trade-off: This provides a huge performance boost, serving many requests from \\nmemory without hitting the DB. The cost is that users might see slightly stale data (a seat \\nshown as available might have just been booked). This is an acceptable trade-off for this use \\ncase. \\n    -   Invalidation: The cache must be invalidated when a seat\\'s status changes. Use \\n`@CacheEvict(\"availableSeats\", allEntries=true)` on the service methods that change seat \\nstatus (e.g., `createBooking`, `checkIn`, `checkOut`). \\n \\n-   Level 2: Distributed Cache (Redis) \\n    -   If the application is scaled horizontally (see below), a local cache is insufficient, as each \\ninstance would have its own inconsistent cache. \\n    -   Implementation: A distributed cache like Redis would be needed. All application \\ninstances would connect to the same Redis server to store and retrieve cached data. Spring \\nCache provides seamless integration with Redis.'),\n",

It\\'s organized into layers: Controllers are the \\'front \\ndoor\\' that listen for HTTP requests from the app. Services are the \\'brain\\' that contains all the \\nrules, like \\'you can\\'t book a seat if your subscription has expired\\'.

When \\na user creates an account, books a seat, or checks their subscription, the app on their phone \\nis talking to this system.

We built it as one solid, reliable unit to get to market \\nquickly, focusing on the core features: secure login, real-time seat availability, and a fair \\nbooking process. It also has an automated janitor that runs in the background to free up \\nseats that people booked but never used, ensuring the library space is used efficiently.

The service method for \\ncreating a booking places a pessimistic write lock on the seat\\'s row in the database. This \\nforces any other transaction trying to book the same seat to wait. Once the first transaction \\nis complete, the second one will read the updated seat status (now \\'BOOKED\\') and fail \\ncleanly, informing the second user that the seat is no longer available. This guarantees data \\nconsistency. \\n-   Q: A user\\'s JWT is stolen. What\\'s the impact, and how do you limit it? \\n    -   A: The impact is that an attacker can impersonate the user and access any resources \\nthey\\'re authorized to. We limit the impact in two main ways: first, by enforcing HTTPS \\neverywhere, which encrypts the token in transit, making it hard to steal. Second, and most \\nimportantly, our JWTs have a very short expiration time, typically 15 minutes. This means the \\nattacker only has a small window to use the token. For immediate revocation, a more \\ncomplex solution like a token blocklist in Redis would be needed, but short-lived tokens \\nprovide a strong baseline of security. \\n-   Q: The app feels slow when checking for available seats. How would you diagnose and fix \\nthis? \\n    -   A: The first step is to check the database query performance for finding available seats. \\nThis is likely a missing index issue on the `status` column of the `seats` table. If the query is \\nalready optimized, the next step is to implement a caching strategy. Since many users will be \\nrequesting this data, we can cache the list of available seats in memory for a short period, \\nlike 10 seconds, using Spring\\'s `@Cacheable`. This would dramatically reduce database load \\nand improve response times. For a multi-server deployment, this would need to be a \\ndistributed cache like Redis.'),\n",
