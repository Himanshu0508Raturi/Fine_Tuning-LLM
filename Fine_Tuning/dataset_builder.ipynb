      "1. Executive Overview\n",
      "The iLibrary Backend is a Spring Boot monolithic application designed as a comprehensive RESTful API for\n",
      "managing a private study-library system. It addresses typical library needs: user account management, role-\n",
      "based  access,  subscription  plans,  real-time  seat  booking,  and  secure  entry  via  QR  codes\n",
      ".  For\n",
      "example, a student can sign up, purchase a weekly or monthly pass, reserve a study seat for a set duration,\n",
      "receive a QR code by email, and then scan it for library access. All core logic – authentication, payment\n",
      "processing,  and  seat  management  –  is  implemented  within  a  single  deployable  service  (no  separate\n",
      "microservices) for simplicity and cohesion.\n",
      "LLM Fine-Tuning & RAG Context: The repository’s clear structure and rich documentation (interactive API\n",
      "docs, diagrams, and thorough README) make it well-suited for integration into an LLM-based knowledge\n",
      "system. In a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, the system’s documentation and data can be\n",
      "indexed as factual knowledge to reduce hallucinations and provide up-to-date information\n",
      ". In other\n",
      "words, the code and docs are written to be “AI-readable”: endpoints and business logic use consistent\n",
      "terminology (users, bookings, subscriptions), and the architecture is documented so that an LLM can be\n",
      "fine-tuned on the project’s actual functionality. This makes it possible for a future AI assistant to answer\n",
      "questions about how the library system works or even to generate query-specific answers using the\n",

      ".\n",
      "High-Level Architecture: The system follows a 3-tier monolithic architecture: a client (web/mobile front-\n",

      "Non-Goals and Design Trade-offs: iLibrary-Backend  does not include a front-end UI (this is strictly a\n",
      "backend service), nor does it implement a large-scale microservices architecture. The decision to use a\n",
      "single monolithic app was a trade-off for simplicity and ease of development: as noted by industry sources,\n",
      "monoliths allow fast development and easier deployment in the early stages of a project\n",
      ". However, this\n",
      "means  all  features  share  one  codebase  and  deployment.  We  explicitly  omitted  complex  features  like\n",
      "distributed caching, multi-tenant support, and a dedicated reporting service. Authentication is done via\n",
      "stateless JWT tokens (instead of server-side sessions), trading off the complexity of token management for\n",
      "the scalability and decoupling benefits of RESTful auth\n",
      ". The system uses MySQL with Hibernate (for\n",
      "strong relational consistency) rather than a NoSQL store, which is a deliberate choice favoring transactional\n",
      "integrity of bookings over eventual consistency. Real-time seat tracking is implemented with database +\n",
      "Redis  caching,  rather  than  a  full  event-driven  messaging  queue,  to  balance  responsiveness  with\n",
      "implementation complexity.\n",
      "Overall, the architecture is  logical and clear: one unified backend service handles all library operations.\n",
      "This monolithic design was chosen for rapid development and because the domain is tightly coupled\n",
      "(authorization, booking, payments, and notifications all interrelate). Future scaling (if needed) can leverage\n",
      "horizontal container deployment (the app is Dockerized\n",
      ") rather than splitting into microservices at this\n",
      "stage.\n",
      "2. System Architecture (Deep Dive)\n",
      "Monolith vs Microservices\n",
      "The iLibrary system is designed as a  monolithic application rather than a collection of microservices. In\n",
      "practice this means all functionality (controllers, services, persistence, security, etc.) lives in one codebase\n",
      "and one running process. This was a conscious choice: monolithic architectures can significantly speed up\n",
      "development and simplify deployment since there is a single executable unit\n",
      ". For a moderately sized\n",
      "system like this, splitting into microservices would add complexity (service discovery, multiple deployments,\n",
      "network overhead) without proportional benefit. As Atlassian notes, a monolith’s primary advantage is fast\n",
      "development  due  to  simplicity  of  one  codebase\n",
      ".  In  iLibrary’s  case,  features  like  booking  and\n",
      "subscription are closely coupled (e.g. buying a subscription affects booking limits), so a unified codebase\n",
      "avoids complicated inter-service communication. \n",
      "Component  Interaction  Flow: Internally,  iLibrary  follows  a  layered  structure.  Controllers  (Spring\n",
      "@RestController  classes) define REST endpoints (e.g. /public/signup , /booking/seat , /admin/\n",
      "allUsers\n",
      "). Each controller typically calls a  Service class to handle business logic (e.g. booking\n",
      "creation, payment processing). The service layer uses Repository interfaces (Spring Data JPA) to query or\n",

      "2\n",
      "\n",
      "update the database. For example, the flow for a booking request is:\n",
      "1. Client sends POST /booking/seat  with JSON data.\n",
      "2.  The\n",
      " BookingController \n",
      "receives  it  (after  passing  authentication)  and  maps  it  to  a\n",
      "SeatBookingRequest  DTO.\n",
      "3. The controller calls BookingService.bookSeat(...) , passing the validated DTO.\n",
      "4. BookingService  may check seat availability, create a new Booking  entity, update the Seat  entity’s\n",
      "status, and save changes in one transaction.\n",
      "5. After saving, the service enqueues an email (QR code) and returns a success response. \n",
      "Externally,  the  app  interacts  synchronously  with  two  main  external  components:  the  Stripe  API for\n",
      "payments (via REST and webhooks), and an email SMTP server via JavaMail. These interactions are modeled\n",
      "as outbound calls in the service layer. For example, initiating a subscription purchase triggers a redirect to\n",
      "Stripe; when Stripe later posts a webhook, a  WebhookController in the app processes it (marking the\n",
      "subscription as active)\n",
      ". Email sending is typically done asynchronously (Spring Boot can dispatch emails\n",
      "on a separate thread). \n",
      "Sync vs Async Boundaries: Most of the application runs synchronously. HTTP requests enter, go through\n",
      "Spring  MVC  to  controllers,  and  the  processing  completes  within  the  request  thread  (often  in  one\n",
      "transaction). The only asynchronous aspects are:\n",
      "-  Email Notifications: Sending an email to a user (e.g. welcome message or QR code) is done without\n",
      "blocking the main request (handled by Spring’s async task executor).\n",
      "-  Stripe Webhooks: These are inherently asynchronous events that the server receives at any time (e.g.\n",
      "when  a  payment  succeeds).  The  app  handles  them  in  special  controller  endpoints  ( /webhook/\n",
      "subscription  and /webhook/seat\n",
      ").\n",
      "- Caching: Redis is used to cache data reads. This operates transparently in the background, but does not\n",
      "introduce custom messaging queues into the request flow. \n",
      "Thus, the primary failure boundaries are still synchronous. If any synchronous call (database, Stripe REST\n",
      "call, etc.) fails or times out, an exception is thrown back to the client. Webhook processing and email\n",
      "sending failures are logged or retried internally.\n",
      "Data Flow Example: A typical user signup and booking flow is illustrated below (building on the sequence\n",
      "diagram in the docs\n",
      "):\n",
      "-  User Signup: The user submits  /public/signup  (with username, email, password). The controller\n",
      "validates inputs ( @Valid ), prefixes the username with ROLE_USER , hashes the password using BCrypt,\n",
      "and saves a new User entity to MySQL\n",
      ". A welcome email is sent asynchronously. The API returns HTTP\n",
      "201 Created.\n",
      "-  User  Login: The  user  calls  /public/login  with  credentials.  Spring’s  AuthenticationManager\n",
      "verifies them against the database (comparing the BCrypt hash)\n",
      ". On success, the server creates a JWT\n",
      "token (signed with HS256 and a secret key) with the username and role claim, and returns it to the client\n",
      ". The client stores the token.\n",
      "- Authenticated Request: For a protected operation (e.g. booking a seat), the client includes the JWT in the\n",
      "Authorization  header (“Bearer …”). A  JwtRequestFilter  intercepts the request: it extracts and\n",
      "validates the token signature and expiration\n",
      ", and if valid, sets the Spring Security context with the user’s\n",
      "identity and roles (from token claims)\n",
      ". The request is then forwarded to the appropriate controller\n",
      "method (e.g. BookingController.bookSeat() ).\n",
      "-  Booking and Check-in: When booking, the server creates a  Booking  record (status PENDING) and\n",

      "at the library, the front-end posts it back to  /librarian/verify-qr . The controller decodes the JWT\n",
      "embedded in the QR, marks the booking as CONFIRMED in the DB, and allows entry\n",
      ". \n",
      "Failure Propagation: If any step fails (e.g. database down, invalid input, expired token), an exception is\n",
      "thrown and handled by Spring’s exception mechanisms. For instance, invalid JWT results in an HTTP 401\n",
      "Unauthorized. Form validation errors result in 400 Bad Request (handled by  @ControllerAdvice  or\n",
      "Spring’s default). Uncaught exceptions typically return 500 Internal Server Error, with logging. Failures in\n",
      "asynchronous tasks (like email send) are logged and can be retried or alerted via monitoring. In short,\n",
      "failures bubble up to the API level, ensuring clients get appropriate HTTP error codes and messages.\n",
      "3. Repository Walkthrough (Folder-by-Folder)\n",
      "The repository has a simple layout:\n",
      ".idea/  – IDE configuration files (IntelliJ). These contain project settings and should not be removed\n",
      "only if developers rely on them, but they are not needed for compiling or running the app. If\n",
      "removed, only the IDE settings break (not the code).\n",
      "ER-Diagram.png  – An ER diagram image illustrating the database schema. It is purely\n",
      "documentation. Removing it does not affect the code, but one loses the visual schema aid.\n",
      "README.md  – The main documentation (which we are analyzing). It contains project overview, API\n",
      "docs, and instructions. Removing or altering it does not stop the application from running, but\n",
      "severely hampers onboarding and understanding. All the sequence diagrams, config examples, and\n",
      "schemas we reference come from this file\n",
      ".\n",
      "iLibrary/  – This is the Spring Boot application code directory. It contains source ( src/main/\n",
      "java  and src/main/resources ), pom.xml , Docker configuration, etc. This is the core of the\n",

      "packages are organized by function:\n",
      "Controllers ( com.ilibrary.controller  or similar): Java classes annotated with \n",
      "@RestController , each mapping URLs to methods. Examples: PublicController  (handles /\n",

      "4. Backend (Spring Boot)\n",
      "Controller Design\n",
      "The backend exposes a REST API with clearly segmented controllers. Generally, each major function has its\n",
      "own controller class: -  PublicController – handles unauthenticated or initial calls (e.g.  POST /public/\n",
      "signup ,  POST /public/login ,  GET /public/healthCheck )\n",
      ". These endpoints do not require\n",
      "JWT tokens (except for health-check). - BookingController – handles /booking  namespace, e.g. POST /\n",
      "booking/seat  to book a seat,  DELETE /booking/cancel  to cancel a booking\n",
      ". These endpoints\n",
      "require an authenticated user. -  SubscriptionController – handles  /subscription  endpoints ( GET , \n",
      "PATCH  for viewing and renewing subscriptions)\n",
      ". -  AdminController – under  /admin  (e.g.  GET /\n",
      "admin/allUsers ,\n",
      " /admin/allSeats ,\n",
      " /admin/allBooking ,\n",
      " /admin/allSubscription )\n",
      ".\n",
      "Access restricted to admin roles.\n",
      "- PaymentController – /payment  endpoints that initiate Stripe checkout for seats or subscriptions\n",
      ".\n",
      "- WebhookController – /webhook  endpoints for Stripe to POST events when payments complete or fail\n",
      ". \n",
      "Each  controller  is  annotated  with\n",
      " @RestController  \n",
      "and  request-mapping  annotations\n",
      "( @RequestMapping , @PostMapping , etc.). Controllers are intentionally thin: they map HTTP requests to\n",
      "service methods. For example, a booking controller method might look like: \n",
      "@PostMapping(\"/booking/seat\")\n",
      "public ResponseEntity<?> bookSeat(@RequestBody @Valid SeatBookingRequest req,\n",
      "Authentication auth) {\n",
      "BookingResponse res = bookingService.bookSeat(req, auth.getName());\n",
      "return ResponseEntity.ok(res);\n",
      "}\n",
      "Key design points: - Use of DTOs ( @Valid SeatBookingRequest ) to validate JSON input. Controllers do\n",
      "not accept Entity objects directly from the client. - Controllers catch high-level exceptions or rely on a \n",
      "@ControllerAdvice  to convert them into HTTP responses (e.g. return 400 for validation errors). -\n",
      "Endpoint security is mostly configured elsewhere (Spring Security config), but controllers assume a valid\n",
      "authenticated user if needed (obtained via Spring Security’s Authentication  object).\n",
      "DTO vs Entity\n",
      "The code cleanly separates DTOs (data transfer objects) from Entities. Entities (JPA models) represent the\n",
      "database tables with  @Entity  annotations. For instance,  UserEntity  has fields  id ,  username , \n",
      "passwordHash , email , role , etc. These entities are managed by Hibernate. By contrast, DTO classes\n",

      "this manifests as a constraint violation (e.g. updating a seat that is no longer available). The logs\n",
      "might show OptimisticLockException  or a custom error. To diagnose, enable debug logging\n",
      "for Hibernate and watch the SQL for seat updates.\n",
      "Application Crashes: Uncaught exceptions (null pointers, logic bugs) will crash a request thread.\n",
      "Spring Boot by default logs the stacktrace. To debug, ensure the logs capture exceptions, and add\n",
      "try/catch or additional logging around risky operations (e.g. JSON parsing, API calls).\n",
      "Log Trails and Root-Cause Patterns:\n",
      "- Logs should include a correlation ID or at least include the user ID and booking ID for actions. For\n",
      "example, when a booking is created, the log might say: “User johndoe (ID 5) booked seat 101, booking\n",
      "ID=42.” This helps trace an error back to a user action.\n",
      "- The pattern for debugging is usually: identify the last successful log entry and the first error. For instance,\n",
      "if booking fails, find logs from  BookingService.bookSeat(...)  and see if a database insert was\n",
      "attempted.\n",
      "- Unexpected values (e.g. negative hours requested) should be caught by validation, but if not, defensive\n",
      "programming in services should throw clear exceptions (with logging) to root-cause the issue.\n",
      "Prevention:\n",
      "- Comprehensive unit and integration tests (see next section) help catch regressions.\n",
      "- Code reviews ensure no sensitive data is accidentally logged.\n",
      "- Monitoring tools (like Prometheus/Grafana) can watch for spikes in 500 errors.\n",
      "- Circuit breakers (not currently implemented) could help for repeated Stripe failures. \n",

      "11. Performance & Scaling\n",
      "Potential Bottlenecks:\n",
      "- Database Load: All seat availability checks and booking writes hit MySQL. If many users concurrently book\n",
      "or browse seats, DB contention could rise. Using Redis as a cache for read-heavy operations (e.g. listing\n",
      "available seats) mitigates this. Also, enabling connection pooling (default in Spring) helps manage DB\n",
      "connections efficiently.\n",
      "- Stripe and Email Latency: Calling external APIs (Stripe, SMTP) introduces latency. By design, payments\n",
      "use asynchronous webhooks, so the user’s thread waits only for redirect or receipt. Email sending can be\n",
      "delegated to async tasks. If needed, a dedicated messaging system (RabbitMQ) could be added, but\n",
      "currently the setup is lightweight.\n",
      "-  PDF Invoice Generation: The application can generate PDF receipts via iText (as noted in docs). On-\n",
      "demand PDF creation is CPU-bound; if scaled to many users, it could slow responses. A solution is to offload\n",
      "PDF generation to a background task queue or generate them on-the-fly only when requested, caching\n",
      "results. \n",
      "Load Expectations:\n",
      "- This application is intended for moderate load (e.g. a single academic library). The monolithic design and\n",
      "single MySQL instance suggest expecting hundreds (not millions) of simultaneous users. For high load, we\n",
      "would  consider  read  replicas  or  a  sharded  DB  and  microservices,  but  for  now  the  expectation  is\n",
      "manageable with vertical scaling.\n",
      "-  Dockerization  (building  via  docker  build\n",
      ")  and  Docker  Compose  support  suggest  it  is\n",
      "straightforward to run this app in containerized environments (e.g. Kubernetes, ECS). In production, one\n",
      "would run multiple containers behind a load balancer. Because the app is stateless (all state in MySQL/\n",
      "Redis), horizontal scaling is feasible. \n",
      "Caching:\n",
      "- Redis is configured (as per the README\n",
      " and tech stack) for caching. A likely use-case is caching seat\n",
      "availability lists or user session data. Proper cache invalidation is needed: e.g. when a booking is made, the\n",
      "cache entry for that seat or for the seat list must be invalidated. The current code may use simple caching\n",
      "annotations ( @Cacheable ) around repository queries.\n",
      "-  If  not  yet  used  extensively,  enabling  caching  for  read-heavy  queries  (like  findAllSeats  or\n",
      "findUserById ) can reduce DB load. We should profile query times and add caching where performance\n",
      "is critical. \n",
      "Horizontal Scaling:\n",
      "- The application is stateless with JWT tokens, so we can run multiple instances of it behind a load balancer.\n",
      "The only state is in MySQL and Redis, which can be shared across instances. For horizontal scaling, we\n",
      "would launch more containers/instances of the Spring Boot app (for example, using Docker Compose or\n",
      "Kubernetes) and connect them to the same DB/Redis cluster.\n",
      "- MySQL itself could become a bottleneck. In high-scale scenarios, we might migrate MySQL to a managed\n",
      "service (AWS RDS/Aurora) with read replicas. Redis could be scaled as a cluster.\n",
      "- The Docker support (in README) suggests we can deploy the app as containers in the cloud; nothing in the\n",
      "code ties it to a single server, so load balancing should be straightforward.\n",

      "12. Testing Strategy\n",
      "The README provides commands to run tests (using Maven Wrapper):\n",
      "./mvnw test\n",
      "./mvnw test jacoco:report\n",
      "```\n",
      ". This implies a test suite exists (likely JUnit tests). Ideally, the \n",
      "tests cover each major component:\n",
      "- **Unit Tests:** For individual services and utilities. For example, tests for \n",
      "`JwtUtil` to ensure token creation and validation works, tests for \n",
      "`BookingService` logic (possibly using mocks for repositories).\n",
      "- **Controller Tests:** Using Spring’s `MockMvc` to simulate HTTP requests and \n",
      "assert responses. For instance, tests for `PublicController` that hit `/signup` \n",
      "or `/login`.\n",
      "- **Integration Tests:** Spinning up an in-memory database (H2) or test \n",
      "container, running the full Spring context to test JPA mappings. For example, \n",
      "inserting a `User` and retrieving via `UserRepository`.\n",
      "**Security Testing:** There should be tests ensuring protected endpoints return \n",
      "401 when no token is provided, and 403 for insufficient roles. Tests could use \n",
      "`@WithMockUser` in Spring to simulate authentication.\n",
      "**Test Gaps:** If the repo’s tests are minimal or missing (not visible), then \n",
      "this is a noted gap. We would add more coverage for:\n",
      "- Edge cases (e.g. booking beyond available hours, expired subscriptions).\n",
      "- Failure cases (e.g. invalid inputs).\n",
      "- Payment flow simulations (mocking Stripe).\n",
      "- Concurrency (could write multithreaded tests for booking).\n",
      "- Integration of email (mock the `JavaMailSender` to avoid real emails in \n",
      "tests).\n",
      "We should also include security tests (pen-testing style), but since code is \n",
      "strictly backend, that may be beyond scope here.\n",
      "In summary, a strong testing strategy includes unit, integration, and security \n",
      "tests, ideally with Continuous Integration. The README’s mention of \n",
      "`jacoco:report` shows code coverage analysis is supported.\n",
      "## 13. Versioning & Evolution  \n",
      "**Version Control:** The repository currently has no formal releases or version \n",
      "tags (as indicated by “No releases published”\n",
      "). All development is happening \n",
      "on `main`. In a production scenario, we would adopt semantic versioning (e.g. \n",
      "v1.0.0) and tag releases. Breaking changes (e.g. altering API endpoints) would \n",
      "bump the major version. Bug fixes would go in patch releases. A `CHANGELOG.md` \n",
      "could help track improvements over time.\n",
      "31\n",
      "32\n",
      "15\n",
      "\n",
      "**Evolution:** New features or fixes should follow GitFlow or trunk-based \n",
      "development with pull requests. For example, if we add a mobile app client in \n",
      "future, any API extensions (like `/api/v2`) must be documented and versioned \n",
      "carefully to avoid breaking existing clients.\n",
      "**Breaking Changes:** Any change that affects the API (URL or request format) is \n",
      "breaking. For instance, changing `POST /booking/seat` to require an extra field \n",
      "would require a new version or backward compatibility. We should plan such \n",
      "changes during low-usage windows and notify API consumers (even though this is \n",
      "an internal system, meaning likely only our own front-end uses it).\n",
      "**Future Roadmap (AI Integration):** Since the system is now “LLM-ready,” a \n",
      "potential future is to integrate an AI assistant for library management. For \n",
      "example:\n",
      "- A chatbot for students to query available seats or subscription status (using \n",
      "RAG on documentation).\n",
      "- AI-driven analytics: ingest usage data (bookings) and have the LLM suggest \n",
      "optimal seat arrangements or identify peak times.\n",
      "- These could involve adding new endpoints or data exports, but importantly they \n",
      "rely on the clear data model we have. \n",
      "- Another future step might be embedding this backend in a broader RAG system – \n",
      "e.g. indexing its docs and schemas into a knowledge base (via LlamaIndex or \n",
      "similar) so that an LLM can answer “How do I reserve a study seat?” using the \n",
      "actual code and docs as context.\n",
      "## 14. Interview-Level Explanations  \n",
      "**Explain to a Junior Engineer:**  \n",
      "“iLibrary-Backend is like the back office of a library. Think of it as a \n",
      "restaurant kitchen: the *Client* (front-end app) places orders (requests) to the \n",
      "*Kitchen* (our Spring Boot server), which cooks up answers. For example, you \n",
      "place an order “I want to create an account” or “Reserve seat #12 for 2 hours,” \n",
      "and the server checks ingredients (database records) and returns the result. We \n",
      "keep user data in a database (MySQL), send emails via an SMTP service, and \n",
      "handle payments through Stripe. The code is organized so that each function \n",
      "(like signup, booking, admin tasks) has its own Java class (Controller), and \n",
      "those call other classes (Service and Repository) under the hood. We use JWT \n",
      "tokens like restaurant tickets: once you log in, you get a token you show at the \n",
      "door to access other services.”\n",
      "**Explain to a Senior Engineer:**  \n",
      "“iLibrary is a modular Spring Boot monolith designed for clarity and \n",
      "maintainability. We have layered architecture: controllers handle REST \n",
      "endpoints, services implement domain logic, and Spring Data repositories handle \n",
      "persistence to a MySQL schema. Authentication is stateless JWT with roles \n",
      "enforced via Spring Security (ROLE_USER vs ROLE_ADMIN). We have endpoints for \n",
      "booking, subscriptions (Stripe integration), and admin reporting. The system \n",
      "16\n",
      "\n",
      "uses caching (Redis) for hot data (e.g. seat availability) and runs in Docker \n",
      "containers, enabling horizontal scaling. We prioritized coherence over \n",
      "microservices (monolith was chosen for rapid feature iteration as per \n",
      "[Atlassian] guidance\n",
      "). The codebase is well-documented (Swagger UI, diagrams, \n",
      "code comments) to facilitate easy onboarding. In a team, we’d continue adding \n",
      "unit/integration tests, use CI/CD to enforce quality, and may eventually \n",
      "consider splitting services if the load grows substantially.”\n",
      "**Explain to an AI/LLM Engineer:**  \n",
      "“From an LLM perspective, the iLibrary codebase is structured with clear domain \n",
      "language and docs, making it a good candidate for knowledge extraction. We can \n",
      "index the README, class and method names, and API docs to build a retrieval \n",
      "database. For example, if we ask a future assistant “How do I cancel a seat \n",
      "booking?”, it could retrieve the `/booking/cancel` endpoint definition and even \n",
      "reference the sequence diagram (QR code flow) for context. The system’s \n",
      "consistent use of terms (User, Booking, Subscription) and layered architecture \n",
      "makes fine-tuning a model on this code feasible. Essentially, each API endpoint \n",
      "and data model can become a “document” in an embedding store. Then an LLM can \n",
      "answer queries by combining this factual base with generative capabilities, \n",
      "reducing hallucinations\n",
      ". Our design choices (monolithic, straightforward \n",
      "schema, JSON schemas) also help ensure the data is well-aligned and minimal \n",
      "confounding jargon for training.”\n",
      "**Common Q&A:**  \n",
      "- *Why not use microservices?* Because the domain is not large enough to justify \n",
      "the complexity. A monolith lets us develop and deploy faster\n",
      ". We can always \n",
      "break it later if needed.  \n",
      "- *Why JWT instead of sessions?* JWT keeps the app stateless and allows \n",
      "horizontal scaling (no session store needed). It’s standard for modern REST APIs \n",
      "(and the README specifically calls it “Secure token-based authentication”\n",
      ").  \n",
      "- *What about concurrency on bookings?* We rely on transactional DB updates. In \n",
      "case of a race, the DB will block one transaction (or throw an exception) and we \n",
      "handle that by retrying or telling the user the seat is no longer available. For \n",
      "a single-library use-case, this has been adequate.  \n",
      "- *Why MySQL vs NoSQL?* We needed relational constraints (like linking bookings \n",
      "to users and seats). SQL is simpler for these one-to-many relationships\n",
      ", and \n",
      "we benefit from transactions. A NoSQL store would complicate queries.  \n",
      "- *How to handle failures?* We log errors and return proper HTTP codes. For \n",
      "example, if payment fails, we log the webhook payload and update the booking \n",
      "status to FAILED, allowing retry. Unit and integration tests cover most \n",

      "`iLibrary-Backend` system. It is intended for software engineers, architects, and technical \n",
      "managers involved in the development, maintenance, and scaling of this service. Its goal is \n",

      "## 1. Executive Overview \n",
      " \n",
      "### 1.1. Problem(s) This System Solves \n",
      "The `iLibrary-Backend` system is designed to solve the core operational challenges of \n",
      "managing a private, physical study library. In traditional library settings, key activities are \n",
      "often manual, inefficient, and lack real-time visibility. This system digitizes and automates \n",
      "these processes. \n",
      " \n",
      "The primary problems solved are: \n",
      "- Inefficient Seat Management: Students struggle to find available seats, and administrators \n",
      "have no real-time view of occupancy. This leads to wasted time for students and \n",
      "underutilization of library space. \n",
      "- Manual User & Subscription Handling: Onboarding new members, managing subscription \n",
      "payments, and enforcing access rights based on subscription status is often a paper-based or \n",
      "spreadsheet-driven process, prone to errors and administrative overhead. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Lack of Access Control: Ensuring only subscribed, active members can enter and use the \n",
      "facility requires constant manual verification, which is not scalable. \n",
      "- \"Seat Hogging\": Users occupying seats for extended periods without actually using them \n",
      "(e.g., leaving their belongings and disappearing for hours) prevent others from using the \n",
      "space. \n",
      " \n",
      "The system addresses these issues by providing a centralized, automated platform for user \n",
      "management, seat booking, real-time availability tracking, and secure, automated access \n",
      "control. \n",
      " \n",
      "### 1.2. Why These Projects Were Combined \n",
      "This repository, while appearing as a single `iLibrary-Backend` project, implicitly integrates \n",
      "several logical \"sub-projects\" or domains into a cohesive monolith: \n",
      " \n",
      "1.  Identity & Access Management (IAM): Handles user registration, authentication (JWT), \n",
      "and role-based authorization. This is the security foundation. \n",
      "2.  Subscription & Billing Management: Manages user subscription tiers, status \n",

      "Flow Description: \n",
      "1.  Clients: Users interact with the system via client applications (not included in this repo), \n",
      "which could be a web front-end or a mobile app. These clients communicate with the \n",
      "backend exclusively through a REST API over HTTPS. \n",
      "\n",
      "2.  API Layer: The entry point is the `Controller` layer, which exposes HTTP endpoints. It uses \n",
      "Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to define the API contract, decoupling the API from the internal \n",
      "database structure. \n",
      "3.  Security Layer: Every request first passes through the Spring Security filter chain. For \n",
      "protected endpoints, the `JwtAuthenticationFilter` intercepts the request, validates the JWT \n",
      "token from the `Authorization` header, and establishes the user's security context. \n",
      "4.  Business Logic Layer: The `Service` layer contains the core application logic. Controllers \n",
      "delegate calls to these services (e.g., `BookingService`, `UserService`). This layer orchestrates \n",
      "calls to the data access layer and implements the complex business rules. \n",
      "5.  Data Access Layer: This layer is responsible for all database interactions. It consists of JPA \n",
      "`Entity` classes that map to database tables and `Repository` interfaces (Spring Data JPA) \n",
      "that provide CRUD operations and custom queries. \n",
      "6.  Database: A MySQL database (recommended to be hosted on AWS RDS for production) \n",
      "persists all application state: users, seats, bookings, subscriptions, etc. \n",
      "7.  External Integrations: The system integrates with an email service (via JavaMail) to send \n",
      "notifications, such as booking confirmations. It also has an internal scheduler \n",
      "(`@Scheduled`) for automated tasks, which can be thought of as an internal, time-based \n",

      "inconsistency where two users might attempt to book the same seat simultaneously \n",
      "(handled by database constraints). \n",
      "-   No Social Features: This is a utility-focused application. Features like user profiles, \n",
      "messaging, or friend lists are intentionally excluded to keep the scope tight. \n",
      "-   Billing/Payment Gateway is Out of Scope: The system manages `Subscription` status but \n",
      "does not integrate with a payment processor like Stripe. It's assumed that subscription \n",
      "status is updated via an administrative process or a separate, future integration. This was a \n",
      "critical trade-off to simplify the initial build. \n",
      "-   Single-Tenancy: The system is designed for a single library. It is not a multi-tenant SaaS \n",
      "platform. All data (users, seats) coexists within a single database schema. \n",
      "-   Trade-off: Monolith vs. Microservices: The choice of a monolith was a conscious trade-off \n",
      "of future scalability for initial development speed and simplicity. As the system grows, \n",
      "\n",
      "certain components (like Notifications or perhaps a future Payment service) could be \n",
      "extracted into separate services. But for now, the simplicity of a single, deployable unit is a \n",
      "net-win. \n",
      "-   Trade-off: Simple QR Code Logic: The QR code check-in mechanism is based on a simple \n",
      "validation of the booking ID. It's not a cryptographically signed, single-use token. This was a \n",
      "trade-off for implementation simplicity, accepting a minor security risk that a user could \n",

      "## 2. System Architecture (Very Deep) \n",
      " \n",
      "### 2.1. Monolith vs Microservices Reasoning \n",
      "As stated in the overview, the monolithic architecture was a deliberate choice. Let's dive \n",
      "deeper into the reasoning. \n",
      " \n",
      "Arguments for the Monolithic Choice: \n",
      " \n",
      "1.  Transactional Simplicity: The core workflow `(User -> attempts to book Seat)` requires an \n",
      "atomic check: \n",
      "    -   Is the User authenticated? \n",
      "    -   Does the User have an active Subscription? \n",
      "    -   Is the Seat available? \n",
      "    -   Is the User already checked into another seat? \n",
      "    In a monolith, this can be wrapped in a single `@Transactional` method, guaranteeing that \n",
      "the booking is created and the seat status is updated atomically. If any step fails, the entire \n",
      "transaction is rolled back. \n",
      "    In a microservices architecture, this would require complex distributed transaction \n",
      "patterns like Saga or 2-Phase Commit, introducing immense complexity and potential for \n",
      "data inconsistency. \n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "2.  Low Operational Overhead: A single Git repository, a single build pipeline (e.g., `mvn \n",
      "clean install`), a single artifact to deploy (the JAR), and a single service to monitor. For a \n",
      "small team or a single developer, this is manageable. A microservices approach would \n",
      "require a service discovery mechanism, a centralized configuration server, an API gateway, \n",
      "and a much more complex CI/CD and monitoring setup. \n",
      " \n",
      "3.  Performance: For tightly coupled workflows, in-process method calls within a monolith \n",
      "are orders of magnitude faster and more reliable than inter-service network calls in a \n",
      "microservices architecture. The latency introduced by network hops between an \"Auth \n",
      "Service,\" a \"Subscription Service,\" and a \"Booking Service\" would be noticeable and \n",
      "detrimental to the user experience. \n",
      " \n",
      "4.  Refactoring and Code Sharing: It's easy to refactor code and share common modules (like \n",
      "the `exception` or `dto` packages) across the application. In microservices, this would require \n",
      "publishing shared libraries or duplicating code, both of which have their own maintenance \n",
      "challenges. \n",
      " \n",
      "The system is not yet at a scale where the typical drivers for microservices (team autonomy, \n",
      "independent scaling of components, technology heterogeneity) provide a compelling benefit \n",
      "that outweighs this added complexity. \n",
      " \n",
      "### 2.2. Component Interaction Flow \n",
      "Let's trace a critical user journey: A user successfully books a seat and checks in. \n",
      " \n",
      "1.  Authentication: \n",
      "    -   User logs in with credentials. \n",
      "    -   `POST /auth/login` hits `AuthController`. \n",
      "    -   `AuthController` calls `AuthenticationManager` (Spring Security). \n",
      "    -   `UserDetailsService` implementation (`UserInfoService`) loads the user from the DB. \n",
      "    -   If credentials are valid, `JwtService` generates a JWT token. \n",
      "    -   Token is returned to the client. \n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "2.  Booking a Seat: \n",
      "    -   User (now with a valid JWT) requests to book a seat. \n",
      "    -   `POST /bookings/book/{seatId}` hits `BookingController`. \n",
      "    -   The request first passes through `JwtAuthenticationFilter`. The filter validates the JWT, \n",
      "extracts the user's identity, and populates the `SecurityContextHolder`. The request is now \n",
      "authenticated. \n",
      "    -   `BookingController` method is invoked. It extracts `seatId` from the path and the user's \n",
      "identity from the `SecurityContext`. \n",
      "    -   `BookingController` calls `bookingService.createBooking(seatId, userDetails)`. \n",
      "    -   Inside `BookingService.createBooking` (a `@Transactional` method): \n",
      "        a.  It fetches the `User` entity from the DB. \n",
      "        b.  It fetches the `Seat` entity from the DB and places a pessimistic lock on the row to \n",
      "prevent race conditions (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`). \n",
      "        c.  Validation runs: \n",
      "            i.  Is the user's subscription active? \n",
      "            ii. Is the seat's status `AVAILABLE`? \n",
      "            iii. Does this user already have an active booking? \n",
      "        d.  If validation passes, it creates a new `Booking` entity, setting its status to \n",
      "`CONFIRMED`. \n",
      "        e.  It updates the `Seat` entity's status to `BOOKED`. \n",
      "        f.  It saves both the new `Booking` and the updated `Seat` to the database. \n",
      "        g. The transaction commits. \n",
      "    -   `BookingService` returns a success response DTO. \n",
      "    -   `BookingController` sends a `201 Created` HTTP response to the client. \n",
      " \n",
      "3.  Check-in via QR Code: \n",
      "    -   User is at the library and scans a QR code at the booked seat. The QR code contains the \n",
      "booking ID. \n",
      "    -   Client app sends `POST /bookings/check-in/{bookingId}`. \n",
      "    -   Request is authenticated by `JwtAuthenticationFilter`. \n",
      "\n",
      "    -   `BookingController` calls `bookingService.checkIn(bookingId)`. \n",
      "    -   Inside `BookingService.checkIn` (a `@Transactional` method): \n",
      "        a.  Fetches the `Booking` entity by `bookingId`. \n",
      "        b.  Validation runs: \n",
      "            i.  Does the booking exist? \n",
      "            ii. Is the booking status `CONFIRMED`? (Not already checked-in or expired). \n",
      "            iii. Does the booking belong to the currently authenticated user? \n",
      "        c.  If validation passes, it updates the `Booking` status to `CHECKED_IN` and sets the \n",
      "`checkInTime`. \n",
      "        d.  It fetches the associated `Seat` and updates its status to `OCCUPIED`. \n",
      "        e.  Saves both entities. Transaction commits. \n",
      "    -   A success response is returned. \n",
      " \n",
      "### 2.3. Sync vs. Async Decisions \n",
      " \n",
      "-   Primarily Synchronous: The vast majority of the system's operations are synchronous. \n",
      "User-facing actions like logging in, booking a seat, or checking availability require an \n",
      "immediate response. The request-response cycle is blocking, which is the standard and \n",
      "simplest model for such operations. \n",
      " \n",
      "-   Asynchronous Operations: \n",
      "    1.  Email Notifications: While not explicitly implemented in the provided code, sending an \n",
      "email confirmation after a booking is a classic candidate for async execution. If done \n",
      "synchronously, an SMTP server delay would increase the API response time. The ideal \n",
      "implementation would be: \n",
      "        -   The `BookingService` completes the booking transaction. \n",
      "        -   It publishes a `BookingConfirmedEvent`. \n",
      "        -   An `@Async` or `@EventListener` component listens for this event and handles the \n",
      "email sending in a separate thread. This way, the user's API call returns instantly, and the \n",
      "email is sent in the background. \n",
      "\n",
      "    2.  Scheduled Tasks: The `SeatReleaseScheduler` is inherently asynchronous from the \n",
      "user's perspective. It runs on a fixed schedule (`cron` expression) in a background thread \n",
      "pool managed by Spring's Task Scheduler. It independently queries the database and \n",
      "performs actions without any direct user request triggering it. \n",
      " \n",
      "### 2.4. Data Flow (Request → Processing → Storage → Response) \n",
      " \n",
      "Let's trace the data objects for a `POST /auth/register` call: \n",
      " \n",
      "1.  Request (Raw HTTP): \n",
      "    ```http \n",

      "    -   Controller: Jackson library deserializes the JSON payload into a `User` object (which is \n",
      "being used as a DTO here, a slight anti-pattern). The `@RequestBody User user` parameter in \n",

      "    -   Service: The `User` object is passed to `userService.addUser(user)`. Inside this service: \n",

      "        -   The `User` object's password field is replaced with this hash. \n",
      "    -   Data Access Layer (JPA): \n",
      "        -   The `userService` calls `userRepository.save(user)`. \n",

      "The controller layer in `iLibrary-Backend` is designed to be a thin, clean, and focused entry \n",

      " \n",
      "-   Responsibility Separation: Controllers are strictly responsible for handling HTTP-specific \n",
      "concerns. This includes: \n",
      "    -   Mapping endpoints (`@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`). \n",
      "    -   Extracting data from the request (path variables, request bodies, parameters). \n",
      "    -   Invoking the appropriate service layer method. \n",
      "    -   Returning a `ResponseEntity` with the correct HTTP status code and body. \n",
      "-   No Business Logic: Controllers contain zero business logic. All decision-making, data \n",
      "manipulation, and orchestration are delegated to the `Service` layer. A controller method \n",
      "should ideally be a one-line call to a service. This makes the code easier to test and reason \n",
      "about, as the web layer is decoupled from the core rules of the application. \n",
      "-   Statelessness: The controllers are stateless, in line with REST principles. Each API request \n",
      "contains all the information needed to process it. The server does not store any client \n",
      "session state between requests. State is managed via JWTs for authentication and persisted \n",
      "in the database. \n",
      "-   DTO-Centric (Aspirational): The ideal design, and one the project partially follows, is to use \n",
      "Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for all request and response bodies. This decouples the API's \n",
      "public contract from the internal database schema (`Entity`). \n",
      "    -   Benefit: If you need to refactor an `Entity` (e.g., rename a column), you don't break the \n",
      "public API. You simply adjust the mapping between the DTO and the Entity. \n",
      "    -   Current State: The project sometimes passes JPA `Entity` objects directly to and from \n",
      "controllers (`@RequestBody User user`). While this is faster to implement, it's a technical \n",
      "debt. It tightly couples the API to the database structure and can lead to bugs, such as \n",
      "inadvertently exposing sensitive fields (like a password hash) or creating complex object \n",
      "graphs that Jackson (the JSON serializer) struggles with. \n",

      "\n",
      "1.  Login Request: The user sends their email and password to `POST /auth/login`. \n",
      "2.  Authentication: Spring Security's `AuthenticationManager` uses the custom \n",
      "`UserInfoService` to load the user's details (including the hashed password) from the \n",
      "database. It compares the provided password with the stored hash. \n",
      "3.  Token Generation: If authentication is successful, the `AuthController` calls \n",
      "`jwtService.generateToken(username)`. \n",
      "4.  Inside `JwtService.generateToken`: \n",
      "    a.  It defines the claims for the JWT. A claim is a piece of information asserted about the \n",
      "subject. \n",
      "        -   `iss` (Issuer): The service that issued the token (e.g., \"iLibrary-Backend\"). \n",
      "        -   `sub` (Subject): The username (email) of the user. \n",
      "        -   `iat` (Issued At): The timestamp when the token was created. \n",
      "        -   `exp` (Expiration): The timestamp when the token will expire (e.g., 1 hour from now). \n",
      "        -   Custom Claims: Crucially, it adds the user's roles (e.g., `roles: [\"ROLE_USER\"]`). \n",
      "    b.  It signs the token using a secret key (e.g., HMAC-SHA256). The secret key is a high-\n",
      "entropy string stored securely in `application.properties` (and ideally in a secrets manager in \n",
      "production). \n",
      "    c.  The result is a three-part Base64-encoded string: `header.payload.signature`. \n",
      "5.  Token Response: The JWT is returned to the client in the response body. The client must \n",
      "store this token securely (e.g., in memory or `localStorage`). \n",
      "6.  Subsequent Requests: For every subsequent request to a protected endpoint, the client \n",
      "includes the token in the `Authorization` header. \n",
      "7.  Token Validation (`JwtAuthenticationFilter`): \n",
      "    a.  The filter extracts the token from the header. \n",
      "    b.  It uses `JwtService` to parse and validate the token. This involves: \n",
      "        i.  Checking the signature with the same secret key. If the signature is invalid, the token \n",
      "has been tampered with. \n",
      "        ii. Checking the expiration (`exp`) claim. If the token is expired, it's rejected. \n",
      "    c.  If valid, the claims (subject and roles) are extracted. \n",
      "    d.  A `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` is created with the user's details and \n",
      "authorities (roles). \n",
      "\n",
      "    e.  This token is set in the `SecurityContextHolder`. The request is now considered \n",
      "authenticated. \n",

      "`BookingService` must not only find the booking by `bookingId` but also verify that \n",
      "`booking.getUser().getId()` matches the ID of the currently authenticated user. Failing to do \n",
      "this would allow User A to check out User B's booking. \n",
      "-   Rule: An `ADMIN` can view all bookings, but a `USER` can only view their own. \n",
      "    -   Implementation: The `GET /bookings` endpoint would have two different logic paths \n",
      "based on the user's role. If the user has `ROLE_ADMIN`, the service returns \n",
      "`bookingRepository.findAll()`. If they have `ROLE_USER`, it returns \n",
      "`bookingRepository.findByUserId(currentUserId)`. \n",
      "-   Edge Case: What if an admin's role is revoked while they have an active session? The JWT \n",
      "they hold is still valid until it expires, and it still contains the `ROLE_ADMIN` claim. This is a \n",
      "classic stateless token problem. \n",
      "    -   Mitigation 1 (Simple): Keep token expiration times short (e.g., 15-30 minutes). \n",
      "    -   Mitigation 2 (Complex): Implement a token blocklist. When a user's roles change, their \n",
      "token ID (`jti` claim) is added to a blocklist in a fast-access store like Redis. The \n",
      "`JwtAuthenticationFilter` would need to check this blocklist on every request, which \n",
      "sacrifices the pure statelessness of JWTs but provides immediate revocation. This system \n",
      "does not implement this, trading immediate revocation for simplicity. \n",

      "While not explicitly defined in the JPA entities (can be added with `@Index`), a production \n",
      "database would require the following indexes for performance: \n",
      " \n",
      "-   Primary Keys: All `id` columns are primary keys, which are automatically indexed. \n",
      "-   Foreign Keys: `user_id` and `seat_id` in the `booking` table, and `user_id` in the \n",
      "`subscription` table. Most database systems automatically index foreign keys, but it's critical \n",
      "to ensure this. These are essential for efficient `JOIN` operations. \n",
      "\n",
      "-   `user.email`: A unique index on the `email` column is mandatory for fast lookups during \n",
      "login (`WHERE email = ?`). \n",
      "-   `seat.status`: The `seat` table will be frequently queried to find available seats (`WHERE \n",
      "status = 'AVAILABLE'`). This is a strong candidate for an index. However, since the cardinality \n",
      "is low (only a few distinct statuses), the database's query planner might sometimes opt for a \n",
      "full table scan anyway. \n",
      "-   `booking.status` and `booking.check_in_time`: The `SeatReleaseScheduler` needs to find \n",
      "bookings that are `CONFIRMED` and older than a certain time, or `CHECKED_IN` and older \n",
      "than a certain time. A composite index on `(status, check_in_time)` would be highly effective \n",
      "for this background job. \n",
      " \n",
      "### 5.3. Relationships and Constraints \n",
      "-   `@OneToOne(mappedBy = \"user\")` in `User` and `@OneToOne @JoinColumn(name = \n",
      "\"user_id\")` in `Subscription`: This enforces that one user can have only one subscription \n",

      "-   `@ManyToOne` in `Booking`: Links a booking to a single user and a single seat. \n",
      "-   `@OneToMany(mappedBy = \"user\")` in `User`: Allows navigating from a `User` to all of \n",
      "their `Booking`s. The `mappedBy` attribute indicates that the `Booking` entity is the owner \n",
      "of the relationship (where the foreign key column is). \n",
      "-   Database-level Constraints: Unique constraints on `user.email` and `seat.seat_number` are \n",

      "of a seat and then write a new booking and update the seat's status. If this happens in two \n",

      "\n",
      "`@Transactional` ensures it executes within a single database transaction, providing ACID \n",

      "already exists, the method will join it; otherwise, it will create a new one. This is suitable for \n",
      "most use cases in this application. \n",
      "-   Rollback: By default, transactions are rolled back for any `RuntimeException` but not for \n",
      "checked `Exception`s. This is why it's good practice to use custom runtime exceptions (like \n",
      "`SeatNotAvailableException`) to signal business failures that should trigger a rollback. \n",

      "`Booking` record, but before it can update the `Seat` status, the server crashes. The result is \n",
      "an inconsistent state: a booking exists for a seat that is still marked as `AVAILABLE`. \n",
      "    -   Prevention: `@Transactional` prevents this entirely. The database changes are not made \n",
      "permanent (`COMMIT`) until the method completes successfully. If an error occurs at any \n",
      "point, the transaction is rolled back, and the database is left untouched. \n",
      "-   Retries: \n",
      "    -   Scenario: A `PessimisticLockingFailureException` or \n",
      "`DeadlockLoserDataAccessException` can occur in high-concurrency scenarios. For example, \n",
      "two transactions deadlocking each other while trying to acquire locks on seats. \n",
      "    -   Strategy: This system does not have an explicit retry mechanism. The exception would \n",
      "propagate up and result in a `500` or `409` error. For a more resilient system, one could \n",
      "implement a retry AOP aspect (e.g., using Spring Retry) that re-attempts a `@Transactional` \n",
      "method a few times if it fails due to a transient locking issue. However, this adds complexity \n",
      "and should only be done for specific, known-to-be-transient failures. \n",
      " \n",
      "### 5.6. Data Consistency Guarantees \n",
      "The system provides strong consistency for all its operations, thanks to the combination of a \n",
      "single monolithic application and a single ACID-compliant database (MySQL). \n",
      " \n",
      "-   Read-Your-Writes: When a user books a seat, the subsequent API call to view their \n",

      "should ideally use a pessimistic lock (`@Lock(LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_WRITE)` on the \n",
      "repository method). This tells the database to lock the seat row for the duration of the \n",
      "transaction, forcing concurrent requests for the same seat to wait. This is the safest way to \n",
      "prevent two users from booking the same seat simultaneously. The alternative, optimistic \n",
      "locking (`@Version` column), would allow the second user's transaction to fail with an \n",

      "### 4.1. Controller Design Philosophy \n",
      "The controllers in this application follow a resource-oriented design, which is a core tenet of \n",
      "RESTful web services. Each controller manages a specific domain or resource. \n",
      " \n",
      "-   `AuthController`: Manages the non-resource-specific actions of authentication and user \n",
      "registration. Its endpoints (`/auth/login`, `/auth/register`) are the public gateways to the \n",
      "system. \n",
      "-   `BookingController`: Manages the `Booking` resource. It handles state changes related to \n",
      "a user's booking lifecycle (create, check-in, check-out). \n",
      "-   `SeatController`: Manages the `Seat` resource. It is primarily used for querying seat status \n",
      "and availability, which is a read-heavy operation. \n",
      "-   `SubscriptionController`: Manages the `Subscription` resource, handling its creation and \n",
      "status checks. \n",
      " \n",
      "Key Principles Followed: \n",
      "1.  Statelessness: The API is stateless. Every request from a client must contain all the \n",
      "information needed to be understood and processed. The server does not store any session \n",
      "state between requests. The user's authenticated state is carried in the JWT token. \n",
      "2.  Thin Controllers: The controllers are intentionally \"thin.\" Their sole responsibility is to \n",
      "handle HTTP-specific tasks: parsing request bodies, extracting path variables and \n",
      "\n",
      "parameters, invoking the appropriate service method, and formatting the response. They \n",
      "contain no business logic. \n",
      "3.  Uniform Interface: The API uses standard HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`) to \n",
      "manipulate resources, and standard HTTP status codes (`200 OK`, `201 Created`, `400 Bad \n",
      "Request`, `401 Unauthorized`, `404 Not Found`, `409 Conflict`) to communicate outcomes. \n",
      " \n",
      "### 4.2. DTO vs. Entity Separation \n",
      "A critical architectural principle is the separation of Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) from JPA \n",
      "Entities. \n",
      " \n",
      "-   Entities (`@Entity`): These represent the database schema. They are managed by the \n",
      "persistence context and can be lazily loaded, which can cause issues if they are directly \n",
      "serialized and sent over the network. Exposing entities directly can also leak internal \n",
      "database structure and create security vulnerabilities (e.g., accidentally exposing a user's \n",
      "password hash). \n",
      "-   DTOs (Plain Old Java Objects - POJOs): These are objects that define the \"shape\" of the \n",
      "data for the API. They are dumb data carriers with no behavior. \n",
      " \n",
      "Current Implementation & Refinement: \n",
      "The current `iLibrary-Backend` project sometimes uses entities directly in the controller layer \n",
      "(e.g., taking a `User` entity in the registration endpoint). While this is convenient for small \n",
      "projects, it's an anti-pattern that should be corrected. \n",
      " \n",
      "Recommended (Ideal) Flow: \n",
      "1.  Request: A `POST` request with a `CreateUserRequestDTO` in its body hits the \n",
      "`AuthController`. \n",
      "2.  Controller: The controller receives the `CreateUserRequestDTO`. \n",
      "3.  Mapping: The controller (or a dedicated `Mapper` service) converts the \n",
      "`CreateUserRequestDTO` into a `User` entity. \n",
      "4.  Service: The `User` entity is passed to the `UserService`. \n",
      "5.  Response: The `UserService` returns a saved `User` entity. This is then mapped to a \n",
      "`UserResponseDTO` (which would exclude sensitive fields like the password) before being \n",
      "sent back in the HTTP response. \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "This separation ensures the API contract is stable even if the internal database schema \n",
      "changes, and it prevents accidental data leakage. \n",
      " \n",
      "### 4.3. Validation Strategy \n",
      "Input validation is implemented at the boundary of the system—the controller layer—to \n",
      "ensure data integrity before any business logic is executed. The project uses the Bean \n",
      "Validation API (via `spring-boot-starter-validation`). \n",
      " \n",
      "How it Works: \n",
      "-   Annotations: Constraints are declared directly on the fields of the DTOs (or entities, in the \n",
      "current implementation) using annotations like `@NotNull`, `@Email`, `@Size`, and \n",
      "`@NotBlank`. \n",
      "-   Triggering: The `@Valid` annotation is used on controller method parameters (e.g., \n",
      "`@PostMapping(\"/register\") public String addUser(@RequestBody @Valid User user)`). This \n",
      "tells Spring to trigger the validation process. \n",
      "-   Exception Handling: If validation fails, a `MethodArgumentNotValidException` (for \n",
      "`@RequestBody`) or `ConstraintViolationException` is thrown. This is caught by the \n",
      "`RestResponseEntityExceptionHandler`, which formats a `400 Bad Request` response with a \n",
      "clear, structured error message detailing which fields are invalid and why. This prevents \n",
      "invalid data from ever reaching the service layer. \n",
      " \n",
      "### 4.4. Security Boundaries \n",
      "The primary security boundary is managed by Spring Security. The configuration (in a class \n",
      "like `SecurityConfig`) defines which parts of the API are public and which are protected. \n",
      " \n",
      "-   Public Boundary: Endpoints like `/auth/login`, `/auth/register`, and perhaps `GET \n",
      "/seats/availability` are configured to be `permitAll()`. These can be accessed by any client \n",
      "without authentication. \n",
      "-   Protected Boundary: All other endpoints, especially those that create or modify data (e.g., \n",
      "`POST /bookings/book/`, `POST /admin/`), are protected. The configuration requires a valid, \n",
      "authenticated user (`.anyRequest().authenticated()`). Access is only granted if the \n",
      "`JwtAuthenticationFilter` successfully validates a JWT from the request. \n",
      "\n",
      "-   Role-Based Boundary: Further granularity is achieved with role-based access control \n",
      "(RBAC). For example: \n",
      "    ```java \n",

      "### 4.5. JWT Authentication Flow (Step-by-Step) \n",
      "1.  User Login: The user sends their email and password to `POST /auth/login`. \n",
      "2.  Authentication: Spring Security's `AuthenticationManager` uses the custom \n",
      "`UserInfoService` to load the user from the database by email and compares the provided \n",
      "password with the stored bcrypt hash. \n",
      "3.  Token Generation: If authentication is successful, the `AuthController` calls the \n",
      "`JwtService.generateToken()` method. \n",
      "    -   Inside `JwtService`, a new JWT is built. \n",
      "    -   Claims: The token's payload (claims) is populated with essential, non-sensitive user \n",
      "information: `sub` (subject, usually the email/username), `roles` (the user's roles), `iat` \n",
      "(issued at), and `exp` (expiration time). \n",
      "    -   Signing: The token header and payload are encoded, combined, and then signed using a \n",
      "secret key (e.g., HMAC-SHA256). This signature ensures the token's integrity; any \n",
      "modification will invalidate it. \n",
      "4.  Token Issuance: The signed JWT string is returned to the user in the login response body. \n",
      "5.  Token Storage (Client-Side): The client application (web or mobile) stores this token \n",
      "securely (e.g., in `localStorage` for a web app, though `HttpOnly` cookies are safer against \n",
      "XSS). \n",
      "6.  Subsequent Requests: For every subsequent request to a protected endpoint, the client \n",
      "includes the JWT in the `Authorization` header: `Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>`. \n",
      "7.  Token Validation (Filter): The `JwtAuthenticationFilter` intercepts the request. \n",
      "    -   It extracts the token from the header. \n",
      "    -   It calls `JwtService` to parse and validate the token. Validation involves: \n",
      "\n",
      "        -   Checking the signature with the secret key. \n",
      "        -   Checking the expiration time (`exp` claim). \n",
      "        -   Ensuring the token is well-formed. \n",
      "8.  Security Context Population: If the token is valid, the filter extracts the user's identity \n",
      "(`sub` and `roles` claims), creates an `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` object \n",
      "representing the authenticated user, and sets it in the `SecurityContextHolder`. \n",
      "9.  Access Granted: The request proceeds to the controller. Downstream logic can now \n",
      "access the authenticated user's details via the `SecurityContext`. \n",
      " \n",
      "### 4.6. Authorization Rules and Edge Cases \n",
      "-   Standard Rules: Users can only manage their own resources. For example, in \n",
      "`BookingService.checkOut(bookingId)`, there should be a check: `if \n",
      "(!booking.getUser().getId().equals(currentUser.getId())) { throw new \n",
      "UnauthorizedAccessException(); }`. This prevents a user from checking out another user's \n",
      "booking. \n",
      "-   Admin Override: Admin users (`ROLE_ADMIN`) often bypass these ownership checks. The \n",
      "logic would look like: \n",
      "    ```java \n",
      "    boolean isOwner = booking.getUser().getId().equals(currentUser.getId()); \n",
      "    boolean isAdmin = currentUser.getRoles().contains(\"ROLE_ADMIN\"); \n",
      "    if (!isOwner && !isAdmin) { \n",
      "        throw new UnauthorizedAccessException(); \n",
      "    } \n",
      "    ``` \n",
      "-   Edge Case: Token Expiration: If a user's token expires mid-session, the \n",
      "`JwtAuthenticationFilter` will reject the request, and the client will receive a `401 \n",
      "Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` response. The client-side application must be designed to \n",
      "handle this, typically by redirecting the user to the login page to get a new token. \n",
      "-   Edge Case: Role Change: If an admin revokes a user's roles, the change is not reflected \n",
      "until the user's current JWT expires and they are forced to log in again to get a new token \n",
      "with updated roles. This is a fundamental characteristic of JWT-based systems. For \n",
      "immediate revocation, a token blocklist (e.g., in Redis) would be required, which adds \n",
      "complexity. \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "### 4.7. Error Handling Patterns \n",
      "The system uses a centralized error handling mechanism via a `@ControllerAdvice` class, \n",
      "`RestResponseEntityExceptionHandler`. \n",
      " \n",
      "-   Pattern: Instead of `try-catch` blocks in controllers, services throw specific, unchecked \n",
      "exceptions when a business rule is violated. \n",
      "-   Specific Exceptions: `SeatNotAvailableException`, `BookingNotFoundException`, \n",
      "`SubscriptionExpiredException`. These carry semantic meaning. \n",
      "-   Centralized Handler: The `@ControllerAdvice` class has multiple `@ExceptionHandler` \n",
      "methods, each one tailored to a specific exception type. \n",
      "    -   `handleBookingNotFound(BookingNotFoundException ex)` returns a `4_04 Not Found`. \n",
      "    -   `handleSeatNotAvailable(SeatNotAvailableException ex)` returns a `409 Conflict`. \n",
      "    -   `handleConstraintViolationException(...)` returns a `400 Bad Request`. \n",
      "-   Benefit: This keeps the controller and service code clean and focused on the \"happy path\" \n",
      "logic. Error handling is consistent across the entire API, and it provides structured, machine-\n",
      "readable error responses to the client, which is crucial for good API design. \n",

      " \n",
      "## 5. Database Layer \n",
      " \n",
      "### 5.1. Schema Design Rationale \n",
      "The database schema is designed around the core entities of the library system. It's a \n",
      "relational model that balances normalization with query performance. \n",
      " \n",
      "Tables (Inferred from Entities): \n",
      "-   `users`: Stores user information (`id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `roles`). \n",
      "    -   `email` has a `UNIQUE` constraint to prevent duplicate accounts. \n",
      "-   `subscriptions`: Stores subscription details for each user. \n",
      "\n",
      "    -   `id`, `user_id` (foreign key to `users`), `start_date`, `end_date`, `status` (`ACTIVE`, \n",
      "`EXPIRED`). \n",
      "    -   A user has a `@OneToOne` or `@OneToMany` relationship with subscriptions \n",
      "(depending on whether history is kept). A `@OneToOne` to the current active subscription is \n",
      "common. \n",
      "-   `seats`: Represents the physical seats in the library. \n",
      "    -   `id`, `seat_number`, `status` (`AVAILABLE`, `BOOKED`, `OCCUPIED`, `MAINTENANCE`). \n",
      "    -   `seat_number` should have a `UNIQUE` constraint. \n",
      "-   `bookings`: An associative table that links users and seats for a specific time. \n",
      "    -   `id` (UUID is a good choice), `user_id` (FK to `users`), `seat_id` (FK to `seats`), \n",
      "`booking_time`, `check_in_time`, `check_out_time`, `status` (`CONFIRMED`, `CHECKED_IN`, \n",
      "`COMPLETED`, `EXPIRED`). \n",
      " \n",
      "Rationale: \n",
      "-   Normalization: User and seat information is stored separately to avoid redundancy. A \n",
      "`bookings` table then records the relationship between them, which is a standard \n",
      "normalized design. \n",
      "-   Status Enums: Using `ENUM` types or `String` representations for status fields \n",
      "(`SeatStatus`, `BookingStatus`) makes application logic clear and prevents invalid state \n",
      "values. \n",
      "-   Timestamps: `booking_time`, `check_in_time`, etc., are crucial for the system's logic, \n",
      "especially the automated seat release scheduler. `created_at` and `updated_at` columns \n",
      "(often handled by `@CreationTimestamp` and `@UpdateTimestamp`) are vital for auditing. \n",
      " \n",
      "### 5.2. Indexing Decisions \n",
      "Proper indexing is the most critical factor for database performance. \n",
      " \n",
      "-   Primary Keys (`id`): Automatically indexed. All `findById` lookups are fast. \n",
      "-   Foreign Keys (`user_id`, `seat_id`): Spring Data JPA/Hibernate typically creates indexes on \n",
      "foreign key columns. This is essential for efficient `JOIN` operations (e.g., finding all bookings \n",
      "for a user). \n",
      "-   Query-Driven Indexes: Indexes must be added based on common query patterns. \n",
      "\n",
      "    -   `users(email)`: A unique index on the `email` column is mandatory for fast login lookups \n",
      "and to enforce uniqueness. \n",
      "    -   `seats(status)`: An index on the `status` column is critical for the `GET /seats/availability` \n",
      "endpoint, which will run a query like `SELECT  FROM seats WHERE status = 'AVAILABLE'`. \n",
      "Without this, the database would have to do a full table scan every time a user checks for \n",
      "seats. \n",
      "    -   `bookings(status, user_id)`: A composite index on `(status, user_id)` would speed up \n",
      "finding a user's active bookings (`WHERE user_id = ? AND status IN ('CONFIRMED', \n",
      "'CHECKED_IN')`). \n",
      "    -   `bookings(status, booking_time)`: A composite index on `(status, booking_time)` is \n",
      "essential for the `SeatReleaseScheduler`, which needs to efficiently find all bookings that are \n",
      "`CONFIRMED` and older than a certain threshold. \n",
      " \n",
      "### 5.3. Relationships and Constraints \n",
      "-   `User` to `Subscription`: `@OneToMany`. A user can have multiple subscriptions over time \n",
      "(a history). Or, `@OneToOne` if only the current one matters. The foreign key is in the \n",
      "`subscriptions` table. \n",
      "-   `User` to `Booking`: `@OneToMany`. A user can make many bookings. The foreign key \n",
      "(`user_id`) is in the `bookings` table. \n",
      "-   `Seat` to `Booking`: `@OneToMany`. A seat can be part of many bookings over time. The \n",
      "foreign key (`seat_id`) is in the `bookings` table. \n",
      "-   Constraints: \n",
      "    -   `NOT NULL`: Most foreign key and status columns should be non-nullable. \n",
      "    -   `UNIQUE`: `users.email`, `seats.seat_number`. \n",
      "    -   Cascading: Cascade types should be used carefully. `CascadeType.ALL` from `User` to \n",
      "`Booking` would be dangerous—deleting a user would delete all their past booking history. \n",
      "`CascadeType.PERSIST` and `CascadeType.MERGE` are often safer. Deleting a user should \n",
      "probably be a \"soft delete\" (setting an `is_active` flag to `false`) to preserve historical data \n",
      "integrity. \n",
      " \n",
      "### 5.4. Transaction Boundaries \n",
      "Spring's `@Transactional` annotation is used to define transaction boundaries at the service \n",
      "layer. \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "-   Where it's used: Any service method that performs a write operation, especially those \n",
      "modifying multiple entities, must be transactional. \n",
      "    -   `BookingService.createBooking()`: This is the canonical example. It must create a \n",
      "`Booking` row AND update a `Seat` row. `@Transactional` ensures that if the seat update \n",
      "fails for any reason, the booking creation is rolled back, preventing an inconsistent state (a \n",
      "booking for a seat that still shows as available). \n",
      "    -   `BookingService.checkIn()`: Updates both the `Booking` and `Seat` status. \n",
      "-   Read-Only Transactions: Methods that only read data (e.g., \n",
      "`seatService.findAvailableSeats()`) can be marked with `@Transactional(readOnly = true)`. \n",
      "This provides a performance hint to the persistence provider and the database, which can \n",
      "apply certain optimizations. \n",
      " \n",
      "### 5.5. Failure Scenarios (Data Layer) \n",
      "-   Race Condition (Booking): Two users request `POST /bookings/book/101` for the last seat \n",
      "at the same time. \n",
      "    -   Without Locking: Both threads could read the seat status as `AVAILABLE`, both create a \n",
      "booking, and the last one to write wins. The first user thinks they have a booking, but the \n",
      "seat status is updated by the second user. This is a classic race condition. \n",
      "    -   Mitigation (Pessimistic Locking): The `BookingService` should use \n",
      "`seatRepository.findByIdPessimistic(...)` or an equivalent \n",
      "`@Lock(LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_WRITE)` annotation. The first transaction to read the \n",
      "seat places a database-level lock on the row. The second transaction will block until the first \n",
      "one commits or rolls back, at which point it will read the (now `BOOKED`) status and fail \n",
      "cleanly. \n",
      "    -   Mitigation (Optimistic Locking): Add a `@Version` column to the `Seat` entity. When \n",
      "updating the seat, the `UPDATE` statement includes a `WHERE version = ?` clause. If another \n",
      "transaction has already updated the seat (and incremented its version), the `UPDATE` will \n",
      "affect 0 rows, and Hibernate will throw an `OptimisticLockException`, which can be handled \n",
      "to inform the user to try again. Pessimistic locking is often simpler and more appropriate for \n",
      "high-contention resources like seats. \n",
      "-   Partial Writes: This is exactly what `@Transactional` prevents. Without it, if the \n",
      "`bookingRepository.save()` succeeded but the `seatRepository.save()` failed (e.g., due to a \n",
      "brief network issue), the database would be left in an inconsistent state. \n",
      "\n",
      "-   Deadlocks: If two transactions try to acquire locks on the same set of resources but in a \n",
      "different order, they can deadlock. For example, T1 locks `Seat A` then tries to lock `Seat B`, \n",
      "while T2 locks `Seat B` then tries to lock `Seat A`. The database will detect the deadlock and \n",
      "abort one of the transactions, causing a `DeadlockLoserDataAccessException` to be thrown \n",
      "by Spring. This is rare in this application's simple workflows but can be debugged by \n",
      "ensuring all transactions lock resources in a consistent, canonical order. \n",
      " \n",
      "### 5.6. Data Consistency Guarantees \n",
      "-   Strong Consistency: Within the monolith, the system guarantees strong consistency for all \n",
      "operations, thanks to the ACID properties of the single relational database and the use of \n",
      "transactions. When an API call returns `201 Created` for a booking, the user can be certain \n",
      "that the booking and the updated seat status have been committed to the database and will \n",
      "be visible to all subsequent requests. \n",
      "-   No Eventual Consistency: The system does not rely on eventual consistency models, which \n",

      "-   Q: How do you prevent two users from booking the same seat at the same time? \n",
      "    -   A: We handle this concurrency issue at the database level. The service method for \n",
      "creating a booking places a pessimistic write lock on the seat's row in the database. This \n",
      "forces any other transaction trying to book the same seat to wait. Once the first transaction \n",
      "is complete, the second one will read the updated seat status (now 'BOOKED') and fail \n",
      "cleanly, informing the second user that the seat is no longer available. This guarantees data \n",

      "-   Q: A user's JWT is stolen. What's the impact, and how do you limit it? \n",
      "    -   A: The impact is that an attacker can impersonate the user and access any resources \n",
      "they're authorized to. We limit the impact in two main ways: first, by enforcing HTTPS \n",
      "everywhere, which encrypts the token in transit, making it hard to steal. Second, and most \n",
      "importantly, our JWTs have a very short expiration time, typically 15 minutes. This means the \n",
      "attacker only has a small window to use the token. For immediate revocation, a more \n",

      "===== START OF iLibrary-Backend Internal Documentation.pdf ===== iLibrary-Backend Internal Documentation 1. Executive Overview The iLibrary Backend is a Spring Boot monolithic application designed as a comprehensive RESTful API for managing a private study-library system. It addresses typical library needs: user account management, role- based access, subscription plans, real-time seat booking, and secure entry via QR codes . For example, a student can sign up, purchase a weekly or monthly pass, reserve a study seat for a set duration, receive a QR code by email, and then scan it for library access. All core logic – authentication, payment processing, and seat management – is implemented within a single deployable service (no separate microservices) for simplicity and cohesion. LLM Fine-Tuning & RAG Context: The repository’s clear structure and rich documentation (interactive API docs, diagrams, and thorough README) make it well-suited for integration into an LLM-based knowledge system. In a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, the system’s documentation and data can be indexed as factual knowledge to reduce hallucinations and provide up-to-date information . In other words, the code and docs are written to be “AI-readable”: endpoints and business logic use consistent terminology (users, bookings, subscriptions), and the architecture is documented so that an LLM can be fine-tuned on the project’s actual functionality. This makes it possible for a future AI assistant to answer questions about how the library system works or even to generate query-specific answers using the codebase as a knowledge source . High-Level Architecture: The system follows a 3-tier monolithic architecture: a client (web/mobile front- end) sends HTTP(S) requests to the Spring Boot API server, which handles business logic and interacts with the underlying databases and external services. A simplified ASCII diagram of the high-level flow is shown below. +-----------+ +------------------+ +--------+ | Client | --HTTP->| iLibrary Backend | --SQL-->| MySQL | | (Frontend)| | (Spring Boot) | | Database| +-----------+ +------------------+ +--------+ | | | \\ v v v v [Redis][JavaMail][Stripe] - Client: The front-end (could be a web app or mobile app) communicates via REST API calls (JSON over HTTP) to the backend. - Spring Boot API: Implements controllers and services for each domain (auth, booking, payment). This single server uses Spring Security for auth, and Spring Data JPA (Hibernate) to talk to MySQL. - MySQL: A relational database storing all entities (users, seats, bookings, payments, etc.) . - Redis: Used as a cache to store frequently accessed data such as seat availability, improving performance . 1 2 3 3 4 5 1 - JavaMail (Email Service): Sends transactional emails (welcome messages, booking confirmations, invoices). - Stripe (Payment): External payment gateway for processing subscriptions and seat booking fees (via webhooks) . Each client request flows synchronously into the application: the controllers validate the request, call service-layer logic, perform database transactions, and return a response. Stripe webhook events and email sending are integrated so that the backend can react to external payment events or send out messages asynchronously as needed. Non-Goals and Design Trade-offs: iLibrary-Backend does not include a front-end UI (this is strictly a backend service), nor does it implement a large-scale microservices architecture. The decision to use a single monolithic app was a trade-off for simplicity and ease of development: as noted by industry sources, monoliths allow fast development and easier deployment in the early stages of a project . However, this means all features share one codebase and deployment. We explicitly omitted complex features like distributed caching, multi-tenant support, and a dedicated reporting service. Authentication is done via stateless JWT tokens (instead of server-side sessions), trading off the complexity of token management for the scalability and decoupling benefits of RESTful auth . The system uses MySQL with Hibernate (for strong relational consistency) rather than a NoSQL store, which is a deliberate choice favoring transactional integrity of bookings over eventual consistency. Real-time seat tracking is implemented with database + Redis caching, rather than a full event-driven messaging queue, to balance responsiveness with implementation complexity. Overall, the architecture is logical and clear: one unified backend service handles all library operations. This monolithic design was chosen for rapid development and because the domain is tightly coupled (authorization, booking, payments, and notifications all interrelate). Future scaling (if needed) can leverage horizontal container deployment (the app is Dockerized ) rather than splitting into microservices at this stage. 2. System Architecture (Deep Dive) Monolith vs Microservices The iLibrary system is designed as a monolithic application rather than a collection of microservices. In practice this means all functionality (controllers, services, persistence, security, etc.) lives in one codebase and one running process. This was a conscious choice: monolithic architectures can significantly speed up development and simplify deployment since there is a single executable unit . For a moderately sized system like this, splitting into microservices would add complexity (service discovery, multiple deployments, network overhead) without proportional benefit. As Atlassian notes, a monolith’s primary advantage is fast development due to simplicity of one codebase . In iLibrary’s case, features like booking and subscription are closely coupled (e.g. buying a subscription affects booking limits), so a unified codebase avoids complicated inter-service communication. Component Interaction Flow: Internally, iLibrary follows a layered structure. Controllers (Spring @RestController classes) define REST endpoints (e.g. /public/signup , /booking/seat , /admin/ allUsers ). Each controller typically calls a Service class to handle business logic (e.g. booking creation, payment processing). The service layer uses Repository interfaces (Spring Data JPA) to query or 5 6 7 6 5 6 6 8 9 2 update the database. For example, the flow for a booking request is: 1. Client sends POST /booking/seat with JSON data. 2. The BookingController receives it (after passing authentication) and maps it to a SeatBookingRequest DTO. 3. The controller calls BookingService.bookSeat(...) , passing the validated DTO. 4. BookingService may check seat availability, create a new Booking entity, update the Seat entity’s status, and save changes in one transaction. 5. After saving, the service enqueues an email (QR code) and returns a success response. Externally, the app interacts synchronously with two main external components: the Stripe API for payments (via REST and webhooks), and an email SMTP server via JavaMail. These interactions are modeled as outbound calls in the service layer. For example, initiating a subscription purchase triggers a redirect to Stripe; when Stripe later posts a webhook, a WebhookController in the app processes it (marking the subscription as active) . Email sending is typically done asynchronously (Spring Boot can dispatch emails on a separate thread). Sync vs Async Boundaries: Most of the application runs synchronously. HTTP requests enter, go through Spring MVC to controllers, and the processing completes within the request thread (often in one transaction). The only asynchronous aspects are: - Email Notifications: Sending an email to a user (e.g. welcome message or QR code) is done without blocking the main request (handled by Spring’s async task executor). - Stripe Webhooks: These are inherently asynchronous events that the server receives at any time (e.g. when a payment succeeds). The app handles them in special controller endpoints ( /webhook/ subscription and /webhook/seat ). - Caching: Redis is used to cache data reads. This operates transparently in the background, but does not introduce custom messaging queues into the request flow. Thus, the primary failure boundaries are still synchronous. If any synchronous call (database, Stripe REST call, etc.) fails or times out, an exception is thrown back to the client. Webhook processing and email sending failures are logged or retried internally. Data Flow Example: A typical user signup and booking flow is illustrated below (building on the sequence diagram in the docs ): - User Signup: The user submits /public/signup (with username, email, password). The controller validates inputs ( @Valid ), prefixes the username with ROLE_USER , hashes the password using BCrypt, and saves a new User entity to MySQL . A welcome email is sent asynchronously. The API returns HTTP 201 Created. - User Login: The user calls /public/login with credentials. Spring’s AuthenticationManager verifies them against the database (comparing the BCrypt hash) . On success, the server creates a JWT token (signed with HS256 and a secret key) with the username and role claim, and returns it to the client . The client stores the token. - Authenticated Request: For a protected operation (e.g. booking a seat), the client includes the JWT in the Authorization header (“Bearer …”). A JwtRequestFilter intercepts the request: it extracts and validates the token signature and expiration , and if valid, sets the Spring Security context with the user’s identity and roles (from token claims) . The request is then forwarded to the appropriate controller method (e.g. BookingController.bookSeat() ). - Booking and Check-in: When booking, the server creates a Booking record (status PENDING) and 10 10 1 11 11 12 7 13 14 3 deducts available hours. It sends the QR token to the user by email. Later, when the user scans the QR code at the library, the front-end posts it back to /librarian/verify-qr . The controller decodes the JWT embedded in the QR, marks the booking as CONFIRMED in the DB, and allows entry . Failure Propagation: If any step fails (e.g. database down, invalid input, expired token), an exception is thrown and handled by Spring’s exception mechanisms. For instance, invalid JWT results in an HTTP 401 Unauthorized. Form validation errors result in 400 Bad Request (handled by @ControllerAdvice or Spring’s default). Uncaught exceptions typically return 500 Internal Server Error, with logging. Failures in asynchronous tasks (like email send) are logged and can be retried or alerted via monitoring. In short, failures bubble up to the API level, ensuring clients get appropriate HTTP error codes and messages. 3. Repository Walkthrough (Folder-by-Folder) The repository has a simple layout: .idea/ – IDE configuration files (IntelliJ). These contain project settings and should not be removed only if developers rely on them, but they are not needed for compiling or running the app. If removed, only the IDE settings break (not the code). ER-Diagram.png – An ER diagram image illustrating the database schema. It is purely documentation. Removing it does not affect the code, but one loses the visual schema aid. README.md – The main documentation (which we are analyzing). It contains project overview, API docs, and instructions. Removing or altering it does not stop the application from running, but severely hampers onboarding and understanding. All the sequence diagrams, config examples, and schemas we reference come from this file . iLibrary/ – This is the Spring Boot application code directory. It contains source ( src/main/ java and src/main/resources ), pom.xml , Docker configuration, etc. This is the core of the project. Removing iLibrary/ would break everything (no code to compile or run). Inside it, packages are organized by function: Controllers ( com.ilibrary.controller or similar): Java classes annotated with @RestController , each mapping URLs to methods. Examples: PublicController (handles / public/* endpoints), BookingController ( /booking ), SubscriptionController ( / subscription ), AdminController ( /admin ), PaymentController ( /payment ), and WebhookController ( /webhook ). These classes orchestrate request handling and use Service classes. Models/Entities ( com.ilibrary.model ): JPA entity classes representing the database tables (e.g. User , Seat , Booking , Subscription , Payment , etc.). These mirror the schema in ER- Diagram.png 15 • • • 1 16 • • • 4 . They often have annotations like @Entity and define relationships ( @ManyToOne , @OneToMany ). DTOs ( com.ilibrary.dto ): Data Transfer Objects used for request and response payloads (e.g. SignupRequest , LoginRequest , SeatBookingRequest , etc.). These are distinct from Entities and often have validation annotations. Repositories ( com.ilibrary.repository ): Interfaces extending JpaRepository for each Entity. For example, UserRepository , BookingRepository , etc. These provide CRUD database access. Removing any repository would break database interactions for its entity. Services ( com.ilibrary.service ): Classes with business logic (e.g. UserService , BookingService ). Controllers delegate to these. If a service is removed, the related functionality collapses. Security ( com.ilibrary.security ): Configuration classes for JWT, filters, and Spring Security settings. Includes classes like JwtUtil (token creation/validation) and JwtRequestFilter . Removing or misconfiguring these would break authentication/authorization. Config/Util: Other components like EmailService (sends emails), StripeService , and CacheConfig (for Redis) may reside here. Resources: application.properties (or .yml ) contains config (datasource URL, JWT secret, etc.) . Also contains schema.sql or data.sql if any, and static files like application.yml , though not explicitly listed. Dockerfile/docker-compose.yml: There is likely a Dockerfile in iLibrary/ and perhaps a docker-compose.yml in the root. The README’s Docker section suggests these exist. Removing the Dockerfile means you cannot easily containerize the app without rewriting that file. An example flow through these modules: A call to /booking/seat enters BookingController . The controller validates input DTO, then calls BookingService . The service may call SeatRepository and BookingRepository to update the database. It might also call EmailService to send a QR code. Each module interacts via clearly defined interfaces (e.g., controllers know services by interface, services know repositories, etc.). None of these folders function in isolation: for instance, controllers depend on services and DTOs; services depend on repositories and entities. In summary, the iLibrary/ directory is the core; it defines all functionality. The other files ( .idea , README.md , ER-Diagram.png ) serve documentation or development convenience but are not needed at runtime (except application.properties inside iLibrary/ ). If the iLibrary folder is absent, 4 • • • • • • 17 • 18 5 the application cannot compile or run. If controllers are removed or endpoints changed, that API functionality breaks. Each folder’s removal leads to predictable failures: removing Security config would open or close the entire API (security would fail), removing model classes means the database entities vanish, etc. 4. Backend (Spring Boot) Controller Design The backend exposes a REST API with clearly segmented controllers. Generally, each major function has its own controller class: - PublicController – handles unauthenticated or initial calls (e.g. POST /public/ signup , POST /public/login , GET /public/healthCheck ) . These endpoints do not require JWT tokens (except for health-check). - BookingController – handles /booking namespace, e.g. POST / booking/seat to book a seat, DELETE /booking/cancel to cancel a booking . These endpoints require an authenticated user. - SubscriptionController – handles /subscription endpoints ( GET , PATCH for viewing and renewing subscriptions) . - AdminController – under /admin (e.g. GET / admin/allUsers , /admin/allSeats , /admin/allBooking , /admin/allSubscription ) . Access restricted to admin roles. - PaymentController – /payment endpoints that initiate Stripe checkout for seats or subscriptions . - WebhookController – /webhook endpoints for Stripe to POST events when payments complete or fail . Each controller is annotated with @RestController and request-mapping annotations ( @RequestMapping , @PostMapping , etc.). Controllers are intentionally thin: they map HTTP requests to service methods. For example, a booking controller method might look like: @PostMapping(\"/booking/seat\") public ResponseEntity<?> bookSeat(@RequestBody @Valid SeatBookingRequest req, Authentication auth) { BookingResponse res = bookingService.bookSeat(req, auth.getName()); return ResponseEntity.ok(res); } Key design points: - Use of DTOs ( @Valid SeatBookingRequest ) to validate JSON input. Controllers do not accept Entity objects directly from the client. - Controllers catch high-level exceptions or rely on a @ControllerAdvice to convert them into HTTP responses (e.g. return 400 for validation errors). - Endpoint security is mostly configured elsewhere (Spring Security config), but controllers assume a valid authenticated user if needed (obtained via Spring Security’s Authentication object). DTO vs Entity The code cleanly separates DTOs (data transfer objects) from Entities. Entities (JPA models) represent the database tables with @Entity annotations. For instance, UserEntity has fields id , username , passwordHash , email , role , etc. These entities are managed by Hibernate. By contrast, DTO classes (e.g. UserSignupRequest , SeatBookingRequest , etc.) are simple POJOs used for request bodies or 8 19 19 9 10 10 6 responses, often in com.ilibrary.dto . They usually have validation annotations ( @NotNull , @Size , etc.) and no persistence logic. When a controller receives a request, it binds JSON into a DTO, validates it ( @Valid ), and then maps it to an Entity or passes it to a service. Service methods then instantiate or update Entities. This separation ensures that the external API schema is decoupled from the internal data model. For example, a signup request DTO might include username and password , but the UserEntity has a passwordHash instead of raw password. Validation Approach Input validation is consistently applied using Spring’s Bean Validation (Hibernate Validator). All request DTOs include annotations like @NotBlank , @Email , or custom validators. Controllers often use @Valid on @RequestBody parameters. The sequence diagram shows “Validate input (@Valid)” before processing signup . Invalid inputs automatically result in 400 responses with error details. This aligns with the README’s mention of bean validation for all inputs . Additionally, the code likely has global exception handling ( @ControllerAdvice ) to catch validation errors and format them. JWT Authentication (Step-by-Step) The system uses JWT tokens for stateless authentication. The flow is as follows (also outlined in the README’s sequence diagrams ): User Registration ( /public/signup ): Controller receives signup data (username, password, email). It calls a UserService which: Validates the data (format, uniqueness). Prefixes the username with ROLE_ (e.g. “ROLE_USER”) to align with Spring Security’s authority convention . Hashes the password using BCrypt and sets it in a new User entity . Saves the entity to the database ( userRepository.save(...) ). Sends a welcome email (asynchronously) via EmailService . Controller returns HTTP 201 Created on success . User Login ( /public/login ): Controller receives credentials (username, password). It uses Spring Security’s AuthenticationManager to authenticate. The manager loads the user from DB and compares the BCrypt hash. Upon successful authentication, the controller generates a JWT: It invokes a JwtUtil.generateToken(username, roles) utility . The utility creates a token payload with the subject (username) and authorities (e.g. ROLE_USER ) and signs it using the HS256 algorithm and a secret key (from application.properties ). The README notes a 10-hour expiration for tokens . The JWT (and user roles) are returned to the client (typically in the response body as JSON). 11 20 11 12 1. 2. 3. ◦ ◦ 11 ◦ 11 ◦ ◦ 4. 11 5. 6. 7. 8. ◦ 7 ◦ 7 9. 7 Protected Requests: For any subsequent protected endpoint, the client includes the JWT in the Authorization: Bearer <token> header. A custom Spring Security filter ( JwtRequestFilter ) intercepts the request . It extracts the token and calls JwtUtil.extractUsername(token) and isTokenValid(token) . If valid (signature and expiration check pass), it calls JwtUtil.extractRoles(token) to get user roles. The filter then creates an Authentication object (e.g. UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken ) with the username and granted authorities, and sets it in the SecurityContextHolder . The request proceeds to the controller, which can now access the authenticated user’s identity via SecurityContext or @AuthenticationPrincipal . If the token is missing, expired, or invalid, the filter aborts and returns HTTP 401 Unauthorized. Role-Based Access: The app configures route authorization based on roles. For example, endpoints under /admin require ROLE_ADMIN , while most /booking and /subscription endpoints require at least ROLE_USER . Spring Security is set up (likely in a WebSecurityConfig class) with .antMatchers(\"/admin/**\").hasRole(\"ADMIN\") , etc. This enforces the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) mentioned in the docs . An authenticated user with only ROLE_USER would get 403 Forbidden if they hit an /admin endpoint. This JWT setup provides a multi-layered security architecture with stateless tokens, as promised in the README . The key steps (validate credentials, generate token, verify on each request) are all handled by Spring components and the custom filter as shown above. Security Boundaries and Edge Cases Security boundaries are clearly defined by roles and token presence. Public endpoints ( /public/* ) are open to anyone. All other endpoints require a valid JWT. Within those, access is further restricted: - User vs Admin: An admin user (with ROLE_ADMIN ) can perform administrative tasks like viewing all bookings or user accounts. Regular users cannot. - Librarian Role: The system mentions a “librarian” role for scanning QR codes, though in practice this might just be an admin or staff user. The /librarian/verify-qr endpoint requires the user to have at least a staff-level role. - Token Expiration: Tokens expire after 10 hours , after which the client must re-authenticate. The flow diagram shows logout or expiration returns to unauthenticated state. Edge Cases: - If a client attempts an action without a token, they get 401. If they have a valid token but try a disallowed role, they get 403. - If a token signature is tampered with or the secret leaked, the filter will detect invalid signature and reject it (this is why the secret must be kept confidential). 10. 11. 12. 13 ◦ 14 ◦ ◦ 14 ◦ 13. 14. 15. 21 2 21 7 8 - If a password is entered incorrectly multiple times, Spring Security may fail authentication; additional measures (not shown) could include account lockout. - Rate limiting is configurable , so the system can throttle repeated requests (e.g. too many login attempts). - Input validation prevents malformed or malicious inputs. For example, all SQL queries go through JPA (parameterized), guarding against injection . Error Handling The backend consistently returns HTTP status codes that match the outcome: - Success: Typical 200 OK for GET/DELETE, 201 Created for successful POST (e.g. user created) . - Client Errors: 400 Bad Request if validation fails ( @Valid triggers this). 401 Unauthorized if authentication fails or token missing/invalid. 403 Forbidden for an authenticated user lacking the required role. - Server Errors: 500 Internal Server Error on uncaught exceptions (database down, null pointer, etc.). The code likely uses @RestControllerAdvice to catch exceptions like EntityNotFound , DataIntegrityViolation , or general Exception , and return meaningful JSON error messages. - The README’s sequence diagrams imply proper response codes (e.g. “201 Created” on signup ). We should ensure to follow that. Logs should be generated at every layer: controllers might log incoming request details, services log important business events (like “Booking X created for user Y”), and exceptions should be logged with stack traces. For example, a failed authentication would be logged by Spring Security, a database constraint violation (like duplicate username) should be caught and logged. This logging aids debugging (see next section). 5. Database Layer The application uses a relational MySQL database. The schema is designed around the key entities that model the library domain . The main tables and their relationships (as depicted in the ER diagram 22 20 23 23 4 9 ) are: Users: Stores user accounts. Fields include id (PK), username , passwordHash , email , role (e.g. USER, ADMIN, LIBRARIAN), and timestamp metadata. Each user has one role (simple string enum). Subscriptions: Each represents a user’s subscription plan (weekly, monthly, yearly). Fields: id , type (enum), amount , start_date , end_date , and status ( active / expired ). There is a foreign key user_id linking to the Users table. Thus, one-to-many relationship: a user can have multiple subscription records over time (or just one active one). We ensure a user’s current subscription is enforced in business logic. Subscription_Payments: Records payments for subscriptions. Fields: id , stripeSessionId , subscription_id (FK to Subscriptions), transactionDate , status , amount , and user_id . Each payment links to a specific subscription. This table tracks Stripe charges (webhook events update the status). Seats: Represents an actual library seat. Fields: id , location (e.g. room/floor), seat_number , and status ( available or booked ). Seat is fairly static; we preload seats in the database (if applicable) and users can change status via bookings. Bookings: A booking attempt by a user. Fields: id , booking_date , start_time , hours (duration), seat_id (FK to Seats), user_id (FK to Users), and status ( PENDING , CONFIRMED , CANCELLED , etc.). A booking is linked many-to-one to both a user and a seat (one user can have many bookings over time; one seat can have many bookings but only one active at a time). The schema enforces seat_id as a foreign key to ensure referential integrity. Seat_Payments: Payments for booking fees. Fields: id , stripeSessionId , seat_id (FK to Seats or to Bookings?), transactionDate , status , amount , user_id . This logs payment transactions related to seats (though the exact relationship to booking may be one-to-one if payment triggers booking). Relationships: The ER diagram shows these relations: - User → Subscription: One user can have multiple subscriptions (history). The Subscriptions table has user_id as FK. - User → Booking: One user can make many bookings. The Bookings table has user_id as FK. - Seat → Booking: One seat can appear in many bookings (over different times); the Bookings table has seat_id as FK. - Subscription → Subscription_Payment: One subscription record can have multiple payments if it’s renewed; subscription_payments.subscription_id is an FK. - Booking → Seat_Payment: Possibly one booking corresponds to one payment; the schema likely relates seat_payments.seat_id (or booking_id ) to the booking. - Other FK constraints enforce data consistency (e.g. deleting a user cascades or is restricted with related subscriptions/bookings). Indexes and Constraints: Primary keys (usually auto-generated IDs) on each table ensure uniqueness. There are unique constraints where needed, e.g. username in Users. Foreign keys enforce valid references (e.g. booking.seat_id must exist in Seats). Indexes should exist on foreign key columns for performance (e.g. index on user_id in Bookings, seat_id , etc.). The Spring JPA entities likely use @ManyToOne and @OneToMany to model these relationships, and JPA automatically adds the necessary foreign keys and indexes. Transaction Handling: The service layer methods that create or update multiple tables use Spring’s @Transactional to ensure atomicity. For example, booking a seat would involve: updating the Seats table (mark as booked), inserting into Bookings , and possibly inserting a Seat_Payment record. If any 4 • • • • • • 10 step fails, the transaction should roll back to prevent partial data. Similarly, user signup and subscription purchase are each wrapped in transactions. Since Stripe and emailing occur outside the DB transaction, the code must handle rollback (e.g. if sending email fails after DB commit, the booking remains in DB; if a critical failure occurs, the service may throw an exception to rollback). Data Consistency & Failure Scenarios: The design assumes that business rules are enforced at the service level (e.g. preventing double-booking a seat). Concurrency control is important: for example, two users trying to book the same seat at once could cause a race. Ideally, the application would use database locking or versioning (optimistic locking via @Version ) on the Seat entity. If not implemented, a conflicting update might cause an error which should be caught and translated to “Seat already booked” message. Failure scenarios: If the database is unreachable, the app will throw an exception on startup or request, and return 500 errors for all endpoints. Partially completed operations will be rolled back by transactions. For external payments, if a Stripe webhook is not received (e.g. network issue), a Subscription might remain in “pending” state; the system should handle retrying or manual reconciliation. The README does not detail every DB failure, but good practice would include error logging and possibly retry logic in the service methods. 9. Security Deep Dive Threat Model The main threats to consider are: unauthorized data access, injection attacks, replay of credentials, and abuse of resources. The system’s defense-in-depth is illustrated in the README . Key security measures include: Authentication & Authorization: JWT tokens with short expiration (10 hours) are used . Secrets are kept server-side, so forging tokens is infeasible if the secret key is secure. Users must re- authenticate after token expiry. Role-based access ensures users can only hit endpoints meant for them (e.g. only admins can delete or view all users) . Password Security: User passwords are never stored in plaintext; they are hashed with BCrypt (a strong adaptive hashing function) . This mitigates risks if the user database is compromised. Input Validation: All user inputs are validated ( @Valid bean validation). This stops malformed or malicious input (e.g. SQL injection attempts) at the controller boundary . Since all database queries use JPA methods or parameterized queries, SQL injection is further prevented by design. Transport Security: While not explicitly in code, it is implied that the service should be deployed over HTTPS in production to protect JWT and data in transit. JWTs in the header mean CSRF is not an issue, but best practice is to also secure CORS (cross-origin requests) as configured (the README mentions CORS config) . Rate Limiting & Brute Force: The README mentions configurable rate limiting . This means login endpoints can be throttled to prevent brute-force attacks, and booking endpoints can be throttled to prevent abuse. Secure Config: Sensitive keys (JWT secret, Stripe API keys) are externalized (via environment variables) to avoid leaking. The JWT secret is not hard-coded but injected from ${JWT_SECRET} in properties . If secrets were compromised, an attacker could forge tokens or charge payments, so these must be protected. 2 24 • 7 21 • 11 25 • 20 • 20 • 22 • 26 11 JWT/Token Misuse Risks Common JWT pitfalls include weak secrets, failure to check signatures, and not handling token revocation. In this system: - The HS256 secret should be long and random; if it were weak or leaked, an attacker could issue valid tokens (authored as any user, including admins). Mitigation: use a strong secret in production. - The JwtUtil must always verify the token’s signature and expiration before trusting it. The sequence flow shows this is done . If the code mistakenly used alg=\"none\" , that would be a vulnerability – one must ensure the token filter rejects unsigned tokens (this is a known JWT security issue). - Token reuse: If a user’s role changes or is deleted, an old JWT might still be valid until expiry. The system does not track token revocation, so this is a known trade-off: it assumes trust until expiry. As a mitigation, critical role changes should either wait out token expiration or an additional mechanism (e.g. token blacklist) should be added. - Session hijacking: Since tokens are stored client-side, if an attacker steals a JWT (e.g. by XSS on a malicious front-end), they can impersonate the user. Protecting the front-end (setting secure cookies, avoiding XSS vulnerabilities) is important. The backend should also set short expiration and consider refresh tokens if needed. Spring Security Integration Spring Security is tightly integrated: - The WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter (or its modern equivalent) defines security rules, such as .antMatchers(\"/public/**\").permitAll() , and .anyRequest().authenticated() . It also registers the JwtRequestFilter before the authentication step. - Password encoding uses Spring’s PasswordEncoder (BCrypt). - The use of AuthenticationManager in PublicController is the standard way to delegate login. - CSRF protection is likely disabled for JWT-based APIs (since tokens prevent CSRF anyway). - CORS is configured (per the README) to allow only certain origins to access the API . These configurations form the security boundary: only authenticated/authorized requests can reach the controllers for protected URLs. Prompt Injection (AI) Considerations While this project does not embed an LLM, the documentation is prepared for possible AI integration. In the context of RAG/AI: - If we allowed users to submit freeform text (e.g. in feedback forms) that was later ingested into a language model prompt, care must be taken to sanitize or filter that text to avoid prompt injection (inserting malicious instructions). - Since endpoints return mainly structured data (JSON bookings, etc.), the risk is low here. However, if any user input is ever fed into an AI-driven chatbot (for example, “Explain my booking history”), proper sanitization and context constraints are needed. - The code uses validation on all inputs, which also guards against injection of unwanted content. Prompt injection mostly applies if we take dynamic user content and pass it verbatim to an AI prompt; in any future AI features, we would isolate or encode data to the LLM rather than concatenating raw inputs. 14 20 12 10. Failure & Debugging Common Failures and Symptoms: Database Connection Errors: If MySQL is down or unreachable, the application will fail on startup (unable to validate schema) or throw exceptions on every repository access. Clients would see HTTP 500 errors. The logs would show stack traces like DataAccessResourceFailureException . To debug, check JDBC URL and credentials (in application.properties ) and that the DB is running. JWT Authentication Failures: A mistyped secret or clock skew could cause token validation to fail. Symptoms: every protected request returns 401. The logs from the JWT filter would mention signature or expiration issues. Fix by verifying the jwt.secret config (e.g. ${JWT_SECRET} should match the one used at generation time). Validation Errors: If clients send bad data (e.g. too short password or invalid email), Spring will throw MethodArgumentNotValidException . Controllers should return a 400 with a message (this should be logged at WARN level). Inspect the validation annotations on DTOs to ensure they match the API spec. External Service Failures: If Stripe’s API key is missing or wrong ( stripe.api.key in config ), payment attempts will fail with Stripe exceptions (logged in the PaymentService). Similarly, email failures (bad SMTP config) will throw exceptions in the JavaMailSender. Such failures should be caught and logged – for debugging, verify the SMTP host/port and credentials (the README uses Gmail SMTP ). Concurrency Issues: Two simultaneous bookings for the same seat may cause one to fail. Typically this manifests as a constraint violation (e.g. updating a seat that is no longer available). The logs might show OptimisticLockException or a custom error. To diagnose, enable debug logging for Hibernate and watch the SQL for seat updates. Application Crashes: Uncaught exceptions (null pointers, logic bugs) will crash a request thread. Spring Boot by default logs the stacktrace. To debug, ensure the logs capture exceptions, and add try/catch or additional logging around risky operations (e.g. JSON parsing, API calls). Log Trails and Root-Cause Patterns: - Logs should include a correlation ID or at least include the user ID and booking ID for actions. For example, when a booking is created, the log might say: “User johndoe (ID 5) booked seat 101, booking ID=42.” This helps trace an error back to a user action. - The pattern for debugging is usually: identify the last successful log entry and the first error. For instance, if booking fails, find logs from BookingService.bookSeat(...) and see if a database insert was attempted. - Unexpected values (e.g. negative hours requested) should be caught by validation, but if not, defensive programming in services should throw clear exceptions (with logging) to root-cause the issue. Prevention: - Comprehensive unit and integration tests (see next section) help catch regressions. - Code reviews ensure no sensitive data is accidentally logged. - Monitoring tools (like Prometheus/Grafana) can watch for spikes in 500 errors. - Circuit breakers (not currently implemented) could help for repeated Stripe failures. • 27 • • • 28 29 • • 13 11. Performance & Scaling Potential Bottlenecks: - Database Load: All seat availability checks and booking writes hit MySQL. If many users concurrently book or browse seats, DB contention could rise. Using Redis as a cache for read-heavy operations (e.g. listing available seats) mitigates this. Also, enabling connection pooling (default in Spring) helps manage DB connections efficiently. - Stripe and Email Latency: Calling external APIs (Stripe, SMTP) introduces latency. By design, payments use asynchronous webhooks, so the user’s thread waits only for redirect or receipt. Email sending can be delegated to async tasks. If needed, a dedicated messaging system (RabbitMQ) could be added, but currently the setup is lightweight. - PDF Invoice Generation: The application can generate PDF receipts via iText (as noted in docs). On- demand PDF creation is CPU-bound; if scaled to many users, it could slow responses. A solution is to offload PDF generation to a background task queue or generate them on-the-fly only when requested, caching results. Load Expectations: - This application is intended for moderate load (e.g. a single academic library). The monolithic design and single MySQL instance suggest expecting hundreds (not millions) of simultaneous users. For high load, we would consider read replicas or a sharded DB and microservices, but for now the expectation is manageable with vertical scaling. - Dockerization (building via docker build ) and Docker Compose support suggest it is straightforward to run this app in containerized environments (e.g. Kubernetes, ECS). In production, one would run multiple containers behind a load balancer. Because the app is stateless (all state in MySQL/ Redis), horizontal scaling is feasible. Caching: - Redis is configured (as per the README and tech stack) for caching. A likely use-case is caching seat availability lists or user session data. Proper cache invalidation is needed: e.g. when a booking is made, the cache entry for that seat or for the seat list must be invalidated. The current code may use simple caching annotations ( @Cacheable ) around repository queries. - If not yet used extensively, enabling caching for read-heavy queries (like findAllSeats or findUserById ) can reduce DB load. We should profile query times and add caching where performance is critical. Horizontal Scaling: - The application is stateless with JWT tokens, so we can run multiple instances of it behind a load balancer. The only state is in MySQL and Redis, which can be shared across instances. For horizontal scaling, we would launch more containers/instances of the Spring Boot app (for example, using Docker Compose or Kubernetes) and connect them to the same DB/Redis cluster. - MySQL itself could become a bottleneck. In high-scale scenarios, we might migrate MySQL to a managed service (AWS RDS/Aurora) with read replicas. Redis could be scaled as a cluster. - The Docker support (in README) suggests we can deploy the app as containers in the cloud; nothing in the code ties it to a single server, so load balancing should be straightforward. 18 30 14 12. Testing Strategy The README provides commands to run tests (using Maven Wrapper): ./mvnw test ./mvnw test jacoco:report ``` . This implies a test suite exists (likely JUnit tests). Ideally, the tests cover each major component: - **Unit Tests:** For individual services and utilities. For example, tests for `JwtUtil` to ensure token creation and validation works, tests for `BookingService` logic (possibly using mocks for repositories). - **Controller Tests:** Using Spring’s `MockMvc` to simulate HTTP requests and assert responses. For instance, tests for `PublicController` that hit `/signup` or `/login`. - **Integration Tests:** Spinning up an in-memory database (H2) or test container, running the full Spring context to test JPA mappings. For example, inserting a `User` and retrieving via `UserRepository`. **Security Testing:** There should be tests ensuring protected endpoints return 401 when no token is provided, and 403 for insufficient roles. Tests could use `@WithMockUser` in Spring to simulate authentication. **Test Gaps:** If the repo’s tests are minimal or missing (not visible), then this is a noted gap. We would add more coverage for: - Edge cases (e.g. booking beyond available hours, expired subscriptions). - Failure cases (e.g. invalid inputs). - Payment flow simulations (mocking Stripe). - Concurrency (could write multithreaded tests for booking). - Integration of email (mock the `JavaMailSender` to avoid real emails in tests). We should also include security tests (pen-testing style), but since code is strictly backend, that may be beyond scope here. In summary, a strong testing strategy includes unit, integration, and security tests, ideally with Continuous Integration. The README’s mention of `jacoco:report` shows code coverage analysis is supported. ## 13. Versioning & Evolution **Version Control:** The repository currently has no formal releases or version tags (as indicated by “No releases published” ). All development is happening on `main`. In a production scenario, we would adopt semantic versioning (e.g. v1.0.0) and tag releases. Breaking changes (e.g. altering API endpoints) would bump the major version. Bug fixes would go in patch releases. A `CHANGELOG.md` could help track improvements over time. 31 32 15 **Evolution:** New features or fixes should follow GitFlow or trunk-based development with pull requests. For example, if we add a mobile app client in future, any API extensions (like `/api/v2`) must be documented and versioned carefully to avoid breaking existing clients. **Breaking Changes:** Any change that affects the API (URL or request format) is breaking. For instance, changing `POST /booking/seat` to require an extra field would require a new version or backward compatibility. We should plan such changes during low-usage windows and notify API consumers (even though this is an internal system, meaning likely only our own front-end uses it). **Future Roadmap (AI Integration):** Since the system is now “LLM-ready,” a potential future is to integrate an AI assistant for library management. For example: - A chatbot for students to query available seats or subscription status (using RAG on documentation). - AI-driven analytics: ingest usage data (bookings) and have the LLM suggest optimal seat arrangements or identify peak times. - These could involve adding new endpoints or data exports, but importantly they rely on the clear data model we have. - Another future step might be embedding this backend in a broader RAG system – e.g. indexing its docs and schemas into a knowledge base (via LlamaIndex or similar) so that an LLM can answer “How do I reserve a study seat?” using the actual code and docs as context. ## 14. Interview-Level Explanations **Explain to a Junior Engineer:** “iLibrary-Backend is like the back office of a library. Think of it as a restaurant kitchen: the *Client* (front-end app) places orders (requests) to the *Kitchen* (our Spring Boot server), which cooks up answers. For example, you place an order “I want to create an account” or “Reserve seat #12 for 2 hours,” and the server checks ingredients (database records) and returns the result. We keep user data in a database (MySQL), send emails via an SMTP service, and handle payments through Stripe. The code is organized so that each function (like signup, booking, admin tasks) has its own Java class (Controller), and those call other classes (Service and Repository) under the hood. We use JWT tokens like restaurant tickets: once you log in, you get a token you show at the door to access other services.” **Explain to a Senior Engineer:** “iLibrary is a modular Spring Boot monolith designed for clarity and maintainability. We have layered architecture: controllers handle REST endpoints, services implement domain logic, and Spring Data repositories handle persistence to a MySQL schema. Authentication is stateless JWT with roles enforced via Spring Security (ROLE_USER vs ROLE_ADMIN). We have endpoints for booking, subscriptions (Stripe integration), and admin reporting. The system 16 uses caching (Redis) for hot data (e.g. seat availability) and runs in Docker containers, enabling horizontal scaling. We prioritized coherence over microservices (monolith was chosen for rapid feature iteration as per [Atlassian] guidance ). The codebase is well-documented (Swagger UI, diagrams, code comments) to facilitate easy onboarding. In a team, we’d continue adding unit/integration tests, use CI/CD to enforce quality, and may eventually consider splitting services if the load grows substantially.” **Explain to an AI/LLM Engineer:** “From an LLM perspective, the iLibrary codebase is structured with clear domain language and docs, making it a good candidate for knowledge extraction. We can index the README, class and method names, and API docs to build a retrieval database. For example, if we ask a future assistant “How do I cancel a seat booking?”, it could retrieve the `/booking/cancel` endpoint definition and even reference the sequence diagram (QR code flow) for context. The system’s consistent use of terms (User, Booking, Subscription) and layered architecture makes fine-tuning a model on this code feasible. Essentially, each API endpoint and data model can become a “document” in an embedding store. Then an LLM can answer queries by combining this factual base with generative capabilities, reducing hallucinations . Our design choices (monolithic, straightforward schema, JSON schemas) also help ensure the data is well-aligned and minimal confounding jargon for training.” **Common Q&A:** - *Why not use microservices?* Because the domain is not large enough to justify the complexity. A monolith lets us develop and deploy faster . We can always break it later if needed. - *Why JWT instead of sessions?* JWT keeps the app stateless and allows horizontal scaling (no session store needed). It’s standard for modern REST APIs (and the README specifically calls it “Secure token-based authentication” ). - *What about concurrency on bookings?* We rely on transactional DB updates. In case of a race, the DB will block one transaction (or throw an exception) and we handle that by retrying or telling the user the seat is no longer available. For a single-library use-case, this has been adequate. - *Why MySQL vs NoSQL?* We needed relational constraints (like linking bookings to users and seats). SQL is simpler for these one-to-many relationships , and we benefit from transactions. A NoSQL store would complicate queries. - *How to handle failures?* We log errors and return proper HTTP codes. For example, if payment fails, we log the webhook payload and update the booking status to FAILED, allowing retry. Unit and integration tests cover most scenarios. We’d also monitor logs and metrics to catch issues early. ## 15. Appendix **Glossary:** - **JWT (JSON Web Token):** A signed token containing JSON claims (user identity and roles). Used for stateless auth . - **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** A technique for LLMs where external 6 3 6 21 4 7 17 documents are fetched as context to improve factual accuracy . Here, our code/ docs could be part of such a document store. - **BCrypt:** A password-hashing function that produces salted hashes. We use it for `passwordHash` in `User` entities to protect passwords . - **Spring Security:** The Spring framework module for securing web apps. It provides filters, auth managers, and annotations (like `@PreAuthorize`). - **Swagger UI:** A web interface (auto-generated by SpringDoc) that lists all REST endpoints and allows “try-it-out” calls. Enabled at `/swagger-ui.html` . **Pseudocode Example – Booking a Seat (Service Layer):** ```java @Transactional public BookingResponse bookSeat(SeatBookingRequest req, String username) { User user = userRepository.findByUsername(username); if (!user.hasActiveSubscription()) { throw new BusinessException(\"Subscription required\"); } Seat seat = seatRepository.findById(req.getSeatId()); if (seat.isBooked()) { throw new BusinessException(\"Seat already booked\"); } // Create booking Booking booking = new Booking(user, seat, req.getStartTime(), req.getHours()); booking.setStatus(PENDING); seat.setStatus(BOOKED); bookingRepository.save(booking); seatRepository.save(seat); // Trigger email with QR emailService.sendBookingQr(user.getEmail(), booking.generateQrToken()); return new BookingResponse(booking.getId(), \"Booking confirmed!\"); } Rejected Design Paths: - Microservices: We considered splitting into auth, booking, and payment services, but decided it added too much inter-service communication overhead for this scale. - OAuth2/Sessions: We briefly explored OAuth2 (with an Authorization Server) but the simpler JWT approach was faster to implement. - NoSQL: We looked at a document DB for bookings, but realized the strong relationships (users ↔ bookings ↔ seats) favored a relational model. - Polling vs Webhooks: For payments, we could have polled Stripe APIs for status, but webhooks are more efficient and real-time (chosen to avoid periodic polling). Further Reading: The Atlassian guide on monoliths vs microservices provides context on when a monolithic approach (like ours) makes sense .

It is intended for software engineers, architects, and technical managers involved in the development, maintenance, and scaling of this service. Its goal is to be the single source of truth, enabling a new engineer to understand, build, and debug the system from the ground up. --- ## 1. Executive Overview ### 1.1. Problem(s) This System Solves The `iLibrary-Backend` system is designed to solve the core operational challenges of managing a private, physical study library. In traditional library settings, key activities are often manual, inefficient, and lack real-time visibility. This system digitizes and automates these processes. The primary problems solved are: - Inefficient Seat Management: Students struggle to find available seats, and administrators have no real-time view of occupancy. This leads to wasted time for students and underutilization of library space. - Manual User & Subscription Handling: Onboarding new members, managing subscription payments, and enforcing access rights based on subscription status is often a paper-based or spreadsheet-driven process, prone to errors and administrative overhead. - Lack of Access Control: Ensuring only subscribed, active members can enter and use the facility requires constant manual verification, which is not scalable. - \"Seat Hogging\": Users occupying seats for extended periods without actually using them (e.g., leaving their belongings and disappearing for hours) prevent others from using the space. The system addresses these issues by providing a centralized, automated platform for user management, seat booking, real-time availability tracking, and secure, automated access control. ### 1.2. Why These Projects Were Combined This repository, while appearing as a single `iLibrary-Backend` project, implicitly integrates several logical \"sub-projects\" or domains into a cohesive monolith: 1. Identity & Access Management (IAM): Handles user registration, authentication (JWT), and role-based authorization. This is the security foundation. 2. Subscription & Billing Management: Manages user subscription tiers, status (active/inactive), and validity. This is the core business logic. 3. Seat & Booking Management: The primary operational component, handling seat inventory, real-time booking, check-in/check-out, and availability tracking. 4. Automated System Operations: A scheduling module responsible for automated tasks like releasing abandoned seats, which ensures resource fairness. These components were combined into a single monolithic backend for several strategic reasons: - Tight Coupling of Business Logic: The core workflows are intrinsically linked. For example, booking a seat (`Booking Management`) requires checking if the user is authenticated (`IAM`) and has an active subscription (`Subscription Management`). Separating these into microservices would introduce significant network overhead and complexity in maintaining data consistency across services. - Simplified Development & Deployment: For a project of this scale, a monolith offers a faster development cycle. A single codebase, a single build process, and a single deployment artifact (the JAR file) dramatically reduce operational complexity compared to managing a distributed system. - Transactional Integrity: The system requires strong transactional guarantees. For example, a user's check-in must atomically update the seat's status and the booking record. A single database backing a monolithic application makes it trivial to enforce these ACID properties. - Early-Stage Project: For a new product or a small team, a monolith is the pragmatic choice to achieve a rapid time-to-market. The architectural overhead of microservices would have slowed down initial development without providing proportional benefits. ### 1.3. High-Level Architecture Diagram (Text Description) The system is a classic 3-tier architecture, implemented as a monolithic Spring Boot application. ```ascii +-----------------+ +---------------------+ +-----------------+ | End-User | | Client Apps | | 3rd Party | | (Student/Admin) | | (Web/Mobile UI) | | (e.g., cron) | +-----------------+ +---------------------+ +-----------------+ | | | | (HTTPS/REST API Calls) | | | | | v v v +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | iLibrary-Backend | | (Spring Boot Monolith on AWS EC2) | | | | +-------------------------+ +-------------------------------------+ | | | API Layer | | Security Layer | | | | (Controllers & DTOs) | | (Spring Security, JWT Filter) | | | +-------------------------+ +-------------------------------------+ | | | | | | v v | | +------------------------------------------------------------------+ | | | Business Logic Layer | | | | (User Mgmt, Subscription Svc, Booking Svc, Scheduling Svc) | | | +------------------------------------------------------------------+ | | | | | v | | +------------------------------------------------------------------+ | | | Data Access Layer | | | | (JPA Repositories, Entities) | | | +------------------------------------------------------------------+ | | | | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | | | | (JDBC) | (SMTP) | (HTTP) v v v +---------------+ +-------------------------+ +-------------------+ | MySQL DB | | JavaMail Sender | | External Services | | (on AWS RDS) | | (e.g., Gmail/SendGrid) | | (if any) | +---------------+ +-------------------------+ +-------------------+ ``` Flow Description: 1. Clients: Users interact with the system via client applications (not included in this repo), which could be a web front-end or a mobile app. These clients communicate with the backend exclusively through a REST API over HTTPS. 2. API Layer: The entry point is the `Controller` layer, which exposes HTTP endpoints. It uses Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to define the API contract, decoupling the API from the internal database structure. 3. Security Layer: Every request first passes through the Spring Security filter chain. For protected endpoints, the `JwtAuthenticationFilter` intercepts the request, validates the JWT token from the `Authorization` header, and establishes the user's security context. 4. Business Logic Layer: The `Service` layer contains the core application logic. Controllers delegate calls to these services (e.g., `BookingService`, `UserService`). This layer orchestrates calls to the data access layer and implements the complex business rules. 5. Data Access Layer: This layer is responsible for all database interactions. It consists of JPA `Entity` classes that map to database tables and `Repository` interfaces (Spring Data JPA) that provide CRUD operations and custom queries. 6. Database: A MySQL database (recommended to be hosted on AWS RDS for production) persists all application state: users, seats, bookings, subscriptions, etc. 7. External Integrations: The system integrates with an email service (via JavaMail) to send notifications, such as booking confirmations. It also has an internal scheduler (`@Scheduled`) for automated tasks, which can be thought of as an internal, time-based trigger. ### 1.4. Non-Goals and Intentional Trade-offs - Not a Real-time Collaborative System: The system is not designed for Google Docs-style real-time updates. Seat availability is \"near real-time.\" There's an accepted, small window of inconsistency where two users might attempt to book the same seat simultaneously (handled by database constraints). - No Social Features: This is a utility-focused application. Features like user profiles, messaging, or friend lists are intentionally excluded to keep the scope tight. - Billing/Payment Gateway is Out of Scope: The system manages `Subscription` status but does not integrate with a payment processor like Stripe. It's assumed that subscription status is updated via an administrative process or a separate, future integration. This was a critical trade-off to simplify the initial build. - Single-Tenancy: The system is designed for a single library. It is not a multi-tenant SaaS platform. All data (users, seats) coexists within a single database schema. - Trade-off: Monolith vs. Microservices: The choice of a monolith was a conscious trade-off of future scalability for initial development speed and simplicity. As the system grows, certain components (like Notifications or perhaps a future Payment service) could be extracted into separate services. But for now, the simplicity of a single, deployable unit is a net-win. - Trade-off: Simple QR Code Logic: The QR code check-in mechanism is based on a simple validation of the booking ID. It's not a cryptographically signed, single-use token. This was a trade-off for implementation simplicity, accepting a minor security risk that a user could theoretically guess a valid booking ID (mitigated by using UUIDs for booking IDs). --- ## 2. System Architecture (Very Deep) ### 2.1. Monolith vs Microservices Reasoning As stated in the overview, the monolithic architecture was a deliberate choice. Let's dive deeper into the reasoning. Arguments for the Monolithic Choice: 1. Transactional Simplicity: The core workflow `(User -> attempts to book Seat)` requires an atomic check: - Is the User authenticated? - Does the User have an active Subscription? - Is the Seat available? - Is the User already checked into another seat? In a monolith, this can be wrapped in a single `@Transactional` method, guaranteeing that the booking is created and the seat status is updated atomically. If any step fails, the entire transaction is rolled back. In a microservices architecture, this would require complex distributed transaction patterns like Saga or 2-Phase Commit, introducing immense complexity and potential for data inconsistency. 2. Low Operational Overhead: A single Git repository, a single build pipeline (e.g., `mvn clean install`), a single artifact to deploy (the JAR), and a single service to monitor. For a small team or a single developer, this is manageable. A microservices approach would require a service discovery mechanism, a centralized configuration server, an API gateway, and a much more complex CI/CD and monitoring setup. 3. Performance: For tightly coupled workflows, in-process method calls within a monolith are orders of magnitude faster and more reliable than inter-service network calls in a microservices architecture. The latency introduced by network hops between an \"Auth Service,\" a \"Subscription Service,\" and a \"Booking Service\" would be noticeable and detrimental to the user experience. 4. Refactoring and Code Sharing: It's easy to refactor code and share common modules (like the `exception` or `dto` packages) across the application. In microservices, this would require publishing shared libraries or duplicating code, both of which have their own maintenance challenges. The system is not yet at a scale where the typical drivers for microservices (team autonomy, independent scaling of components, technology heterogeneity) provide a compelling benefit that outweighs this added complexity. ### 2.2. Component Interaction Flow Let's trace a critical user journey: A user successfully books a seat and checks in. 1. Authentication: - User logs in with credentials. - `POST /auth/login` hits `AuthController`. - `AuthController` calls `AuthenticationManager` (Spring Security). - `UserDetailsService` implementation (`UserInfoService`) loads the user from the DB. - If credentials are valid, `JwtService` generates a JWT token. - Token is returned to the client. 2. Booking a Seat: - User (now with a valid JWT) requests to book a seat. - `POST /bookings/book/{seatId}` hits `BookingController`. - The request first passes through `JwtAuthenticationFilter`. The filter validates the JWT, extracts the user's identity, and populates the `SecurityContextHolder`. The request is now authenticated. - `BookingController` method is invoked. It extracts `seatId` from the path and the user's identity from the `SecurityContext`. - `BookingController` calls `bookingService.createBooking(seatId, userDetails)`. - Inside `BookingService.createBooking` (a `@Transactional` method): a. It fetches the `User` entity from the DB. b. It fetches the `Seat` entity from the DB and places a pessimistic lock on the row to prevent race conditions (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`). c. Validation runs: i. Is the user's subscription active? ii. Is the seat's status `AVAILABLE`? iii. Does this user already have an active booking? d. If validation passes, it creates a new `Booking` entity, setting its status to `CONFIRMED`. e. It updates the `Seat` entity's status to `BOOKED`. f. It saves both the new `Booking` and the updated `Seat` to the database. g. The transaction commits. - `BookingService` returns a success response DTO. - `BookingController` sends a `201 Created` HTTP response to the client. 3. Check-in via QR Code: - User is at the library and scans a QR code at the booked seat. The QR code contains the booking ID. - Client app sends `POST /bookings/check-in/{bookingId}`. - Request is authenticated by `JwtAuthenticationFilter`. - `BookingController` calls `bookingService.checkIn(bookingId)`. - Inside `BookingService.checkIn` (a `@Transactional` method): a. Fetches the `Booking` entity by `bookingId`. b. Validation runs: i. Does the booking exist? ii. Is the booking status `CONFIRMED`? (Not already checked-in or expired). iii. Does the booking belong to the currently authenticated user? c. If validation passes, it updates the `Booking` status to `CHECKED_IN` and sets the `checkInTime`. d. It fetches the associated `Seat` and updates its status to `OCCUPIED`. e. Saves both entities. Transaction commits. - A success response is returned. ### 2.3. Sync vs. Async Decisions - Primarily Synchronous: The vast majority of the system's operations are synchronous. User-facing actions like logging in, booking a seat, or checking availability require an immediate response. The request-response cycle is blocking, which is the standard and simplest model for such operations. - Asynchronous Operations: 1. Email Notifications: While not explicitly implemented in the provided code, sending an email confirmation after a booking is a classic candidate for async execution. If done synchronously, an SMTP server delay would increase the API response time. The ideal implementation would be: - The `BookingService` completes the booking transaction. - It publishes a `BookingConfirmedEvent`. - An `@Async` or `@EventListener` component listens for this event and handles the email sending in a separate thread. This way, the user's API call returns instantly, and the email is sent in the background. 2. Scheduled Tasks: The `SeatReleaseScheduler` is inherently asynchronous from the user's perspective. It runs on a fixed schedule (`cron` expression) in a background thread pool managed by Spring's Task Scheduler. It independently queries the database and performs actions without any direct user request triggering it. ### 2.4. Data Flow (Request → Processing → Storage → Response) Let's trace the data objects for a `POST /auth/register` call: 1. Request (Raw HTTP): ```http POST /auth/register HTTP/1.1 Host: api.ilibrary.com Content-Type: application/json { \"name\": \"John Doe\", \"email\": \"john.doe@example.com\", \"password\": \"strongpassword123\", \"roles\": \"ROLE_USER\" } ``` 2. Processing (Inside the Application): - Controller: Jackson library deserializes the JSON payload into a `User` object (which is being used as a DTO here, a slight anti-pattern). The `@RequestBody User user` parameter in `AuthController.addUser` is populated. - Service: The `User` object is passed to `userService.addUser(user)`. Inside this service: - The raw password (`\"strongpassword123\"`) is extracted. - `passwordEncoder.encode()` is called, transforming it into a bcrypt hash (e.g., `\"$2a$10$...\"`). - The `User` object's password field is replaced with this hash. - Data Access Layer (JPA): - The `userService` calls `userRepository.save(user)`. - Hibernate (the JPA provider) takes the `User` entity object. It translates its fields into an SQL `INSERT` statement. ```sql INSERT INTO user_table (name, email, password, roles) VALUES ('John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', '$2a$10$...', 'ROLE_USER'); ``` 3. Storage (Database): - The MySQL database executes the `INSERT` statement. - A new row is written to the `user_table`. The `id` is auto-generated by the database. The data is now persistent. 4. Response: - The `userRepository.save()` method returns the `User` entity, now including the database-generated ID. - The `userService` returns this entity (or a confirmation string). - The `AuthController` returns a `String \"User Added Successfully\"`. - Spring Boot serializes this into an HTTP response. ```http HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8 User Added Successfully ``` ### 2.5. Failure Propagation Paths - Database Unavailability: - Path: A `BookingController` calls `BookingService`, which calls `BookingRepository`. The repository tries to open a connection to the DB. The connection pool fails to get a valid connection. - Exception: A `java.sql.SQLException` is thrown deep within the JDBC driver. Spring's data access exception translation mechanism catches it and re-throws it as a more specific `DataAccessResourceFailureException` or a similar `DataAccessException`. - Propagation: This unchecked exception propagates up the call stack: `Repository` -> `Service` -> `Controller`. - Handling: The global `RestResponseEntityExceptionHandler` (or a default Spring handler) catches the exception. It logs the error and formats a generic `500 Internal Server Error` response to the client, hiding the internal stack trace. - Result: The user gets an error message. The system remains online but is non-functional until the DB connection is restored. - Invalid User Input (Validation Failure): - Path: A user tries to register with an invalid email. `POST /auth/register` is called with a malformed `User` DTO. - Exception: If using `@Valid` annotation on the controller method, Spring's `MethodValidationPostProcessor` would trigger the validation. A `ConstraintViolationException` would be thrown before the controller method body is even executed. - Propagation: The exception is caught by the `RestResponseEntityExceptionHandler`. - Handling: The `handleConstraintViolationException` method in the handler is invoked. It iterates through the violations, extracts the user-friendly error messages (e.g., \"Email should be valid\"), and builds a structured JSON error response. - Result: The client receives a `400 Bad Request` response with a clear message about what needs to be fixed, e.g., `{\"error\": \"email: must be a well-formed email address\"}`. The business logic is never touched. - Business Logic Failure (Seat Already Booked): - Path: Two users try to book the last available seat at the same time. User A's request reaches the `BookingService` first and gets the pessimistic lock. User B's request arrives moments later. - Propagation: User B's thread will block on `seatRepository.findById(...)` waiting for the lock to be released. Once User A's transaction commits, User B's thread acquires the lock and reads the seat's status, which is now `BOOKED`. - Exception: The business logic check `if (seat.getStatus() != SeatStatus.AVAILABLE)` now fails. The service throws a custom `SeatNotAvailableException`. - Handling: This exception propagates to the `BookingController`. The `RestResponseEntityExceptionHandler` catches it in the `handleSeatNotAvailable` method. - Result: The client for User B receives a `409 Conflict` response with the message \"Seat is not available.\" This is a clean, expected failure, not a system error. --- ## 3. Repository Walkthrough (Folder-by-Folder) The repository follows the standard Maven project structure. The core logic is located in `src/main/java/com/studylibrary`. `iLibrary-Backend` └── `src` └── `main` ├── `java` │ └── `com/studylibrary` │ ├── `controller` │ ├── `dto` │ ├── `entity` │ ├── `exception` │ ├── `filter` │ ├── `repository` │ ├── `scheduler` │ ├── `service` │ └── `LibrarySystemApplication.java` └── `resources` └── `application.properties` ### `com.studylibrary` (Root Package) - `LibrarySystemApplication.java` - Why it exists: This is the main entry point of the Spring Boot application. It contains the `main` method that starts the embedded Tomcat server and bootstraps the entire application context. The `@SpringBootApplication` annotation is a meta-annotation that enables auto-configuration, component scanning, and more. - What breaks if removed: The application cannot be started. It's the executable heart of the system. - Interaction: It implicitly triggers the scanning of all other packages (`controller`, `service`, `repository`, etc.), identifies Spring beans (`@Component`, `@Service`, etc.), and wires them together through dependency injection. ### `controller` - Why it exists: This package adheres to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. It's responsible for defining the API endpoints, handling incoming HTTP requests, and returning HTTP responses. It acts as the bridge between the external world (clients) and the application's business logic. - Files: `AuthController`, `BookingController`, `SeatController`. - What breaks if removed: The entire REST API would cease to exist. Clients would have no way to interact with the application. - Interaction: - Receives requests from the client. - Uses `@Autowired` to get instances of `Service` classes. - Delegates the actual work to the `Service` layer (e.g., `BookingController` calls `BookingService`). - It translates data between `DTOs` (for the API) and internal objects if needed. - It catches exceptions from the service layer and relies on the `exception` package's global handler to format error responses. - Example Flow: A `GET /seats/availability` request is routed by Spring's `DispatcherServlet` to the `getAvailableSeats()` method in `SeatController`. This method calls `seatService.findAvailableSeats()`, gets a `List<Seat>`, maps it to a `List<SeatDTO>`, and returns it. Spring Boot's Jackson integration then serializes this list into a JSON array in the HTTP response. ### `dto` (Data Transfer Object) - Why it exists: This package should exist to hold DTOs. DTOs are plain objects designed to define the structure of data sent to and from the API. Their purpose is to decouple the API contract from the internal database model (`Entity`). Note: This project sometimes uses Entities directly in the controller, which is a common but risky shortcut. A dedicated `dto` package would improve the architecture. - What breaks if removed: If implemented properly, removing this would break the controllers as they would lose their API data structures. In the current state, the impact is lower, but it points to an architectural improvement. - Interaction: DTOs are used in `@RequestBody` and `@ResponseBody` annotations in the `Controller` layer. A `Mapper` component (e.g., using MapStruct or manual mapping) would typically exist to convert between `DTOs` and `Entities`. ### `entity` - Why it exists: This package contains the JPA (Java Persistence API) entities. These are the Java objects that directly map to tables in the MySQL database. They define the schema, relationships (`@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`), and constraints. - Files: `User`, `Seat`, `Booking`, `Subscription`. - What breaks if removed: The entire data persistence mechanism would be gone. The application would have no way to model or interact with the database. Spring Data JPA would fail to start. - Interaction: - Used by `Repository` interfaces to define what kind of data they manage (e.g., `BookingRepository extends JpaRepository<Booking, Long>`). - `Service` layer methods receive and return these entities from repositories to perform business logic. - The JPA provider (Hibernate) uses the annotations on these classes (`@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Id`, `@Column`) to generate SQL queries. ### `exception` - Why it exists: This package centralizes error handling. It contains custom exception classes (`SeatNotAvailableException`, `BookingNotFoundException`) that represent specific business logic failures. It also contains the global exception handler (`RestResponseEntityExceptionHandler`) that catches these exceptions and translates them into meaningful HTTP error responses. - What breaks if removed: - Service layer would have to throw generic exceptions (`RuntimeException`), losing semantic meaning. - The application would lose its clean, structured error response format. Clients would receive generic Spring Boot error pages or uninformative `500 Internal Server Error` responses for business rule violations, which is poor API design. - Interaction: `Service` classes throw these custom exceptions. The `RestResponseEntityExceptionHandler` (annotated with `@ControllerAdvice`) intercepts exceptions thrown from any `Controller` and executes the appropriate `@ExceptionHandler` method to create and return a `ResponseEntity`. ### `filter` - Why it exists: This package holds custom servlet filters, which are components that can intercept and process HTTP requests before they reach the main controller dispatch. Here, it's used for the critical task of security enforcement. - Files: `JwtAuthenticationFilter`. - What breaks if removed: The JWT authentication mechanism would be completely disabled. All endpoints, even those intended to be protected, would be accessible without a valid token. The system would be insecure. - Interaction: The `JwtAuthenticationFilter` is registered with Spring Security's filter chain. For every incoming request, it: 1. Extracts the `Authorization` header. 2. Validates the JWT token using the `JwtService`. 3. If valid, it loads the `UserDetails` from the `UserInfoService`. 4. It creates an `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` and sets it in the `SecurityContextHolder`, making the user's identity available for the rest of the request lifecycle. ### `repository` - Why it exists: This package implements the Data Access Object (DAO) pattern using Spring Data JPA. It defines the interfaces for all database operations. - Files: `BookingRepository`, `SeatRepository`, `SubscriptionRepository`, `UserRepository`. - What breaks if removed: The `Service` layer would have no way to query or persist data. The application would be completely disconnected from its database. - Interaction: These are interfaces that extend `JpaRepository`. Spring Data JPA automatically generates concrete implementations at runtime, providing standard CRUD methods (`save`, `findById`, `findAll`, `delete`). You can also define custom query methods just by declaring their signature (e.g., `findByStatus(SeatStatus status)`) or by using the `@Query` annotation for complex JPQL or native SQL queries. Services `@Autowired` these repository interfaces to work with the database. ### `scheduler` - Why it exists: This package holds background job definitions. It's responsible for tasks that need to run automatically on a schedule, independent of user interactions. - Files: `SeatReleaseScheduler`. - What breaks if removed: The automated release of abandoned seats would stop working. Seats booked but not checked into, or seats left occupied for too long, would remain in that state indefinitely, leading to poor resource utilization. This is a critical business function. - Interaction: The `SeatReleaseScheduler` class is annotated with `@Component` and `@EnableScheduling`. It has methods annotated with `@Scheduled(cron = \"...\")`. Spring's task scheduling framework automatically invokes these methods on a background thread according to the cron expression defined in `application.properties`. These methods typically call `Service` layer functions to execute their logic. ### `service` - Why it exists: This is the core business logic layer. It orchestrates the application's functionality, implementing the complex rules that are the reason for the application's existence. It acts as an intermediary between the web (`Controller`) and data (`Repository`) layers. - Files: `BookingService`, `JwtService`, `SeatService`, `SubscriptionService`, `UserInfoService`. - What breaks if removed: The application's \"brain\" would be gone. Controllers would have no logic to delegate to. The system would be a hollow shell of API endpoints and database tables with no intelligence connecting them. - Interaction: - `@Autowired` by `Controller`s. - `@Autowired` `Repository` interfaces to interact with the database. - Often annotated with `@Transactional` to ensure data consistency for operations that modify multiple tables. - Throws custom exceptions from the `exception` package to signal business rule failures. - The `JwtService` is a specialized service focused on JWT creation and validation. The `UserInfoService` is a security-specific service that integrates with Spring Security to load user data. --- ## 4. Backend (Spring Boot / API Layer) ### 4.1. Controller Design Philosophy The controller layer in `iLibrary-Backend` is designed to be a thin, clean, and focused entry point into the system. The philosophy is as follows: - Responsibility Separation: Controllers are strictly responsible for handling HTTP-specific concerns. This includes: - Mapping endpoints (`@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`). - Extracting data from the request (path variables, request bodies, parameters). - Invoking the appropriate service layer method. - Returning a `ResponseEntity` with the correct HTTP status code and body. - No Business Logic: Controllers contain zero business logic. All decision-making, data manipulation, and orchestration are delegated to the `Service` layer. A controller method should ideally be a one-line call to a service. This makes the code easier to test and reason about, as the web layer is decoupled from the core rules of the application. - Statelessness: The controllers are stateless, in line with REST principles. Each API request contains all the information needed to process it. The server does not store any client session state between requests. State is managed via JWTs for authentication and persisted in the database. - DTO-Centric (Aspirational): The ideal design, and one the project partially follows, is to use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for all request and response bodies. This decouples the API's public contract from the internal database schema (`Entity`). - Benefit: If you need to refactor an `Entity` (e.g., rename a column), you don't break the public API. You simply adjust the mapping between the DTO and the Entity. - Current State: The project sometimes passes JPA `Entity` objects directly to and from controllers (`@RequestBody User user`). While this is faster to implement, it's a technical debt. It tightly couples the API to the database structure and can lead to bugs, such as inadvertently exposing sensitive fields (like a password hash) or creating complex object graphs that Jackson (the JSON serializer) struggles with. ### 4.2. DTO vs Entity Separation - Entity (`com.studylibrary.entity`): - Represents the database schema. - Contains JPA annotations (`@Entity`, `@Id`, `@ManyToOne`, etc.). - Represents the internal, canonical data model. - Managed by the persistence context (Hibernate). - DTO (Data Transfer Object): - Represents the API contract. - A simple POJO (Plain Old Java Object) with fields, getters, and setters. - Contains no persistence annotations. - Used in `@RequestBody` and `ResponseEntity` in the `Controller` layer. - Example: A `UserDTO` would be created to avoid exposing the `password` field in API responses. ```java // In User Entity @Entity public class User { @Id private Long id; private String email; @JsonIgnore // Important but easily forgotten private String password; // ... } // Better: Use a DTO public class UserResponseDTO { private Long id; private String email; private String name; // No password field } ``` ### 4.3. Validation Strategy The system uses Bean Validation (`javax.validation`), a standard Java specification, integrated seamlessly with Spring Boot. - How it Works: 1. Annotations on Entities/DTOs: Constraints are declared directly on the fields of the model classes using annotations like `@NotNull`, `@Email`, `@Size`, `@Pattern`. 2. Triggering Validation: The `@Valid` annotation is placed on the `@RequestBody` parameter in a controller method. 3. Execution: When a request arrives, before the controller method is executed, Spring automatically invokes the validator on the deserialized object. 4. Failure Handling: If validation fails, a `MethodArgumentNotValidException` is thrown. This exception is caught by our `RestResponseEntityExceptionHandler`, which formats a user-friendly `400 Bad Request` response detailing the errors. - Example: ```java // In User entity or a UserRegistrationDTO public class UserRegistrationDTO { @NotNull(message = \"Name cannot be null\") @Size(min = 2, message = \"Name must be at least 2 characters\") private String name; @NotNull(message = \"Email cannot be null\") @Email(message = \"Please provide a valid email address\") private String email; } // In AuthController @PostMapping(\"/register\") public ResponseEntity<?> registerUser(@Valid @RequestBody UserRegistrationDTO userDto) { // ... service call } ``` This declarative approach is powerful because it keeps validation rules coupled with the data model and out of the business logic, making the service layer cleaner. ### 4.4. Security Boundaries The primary security boundary is the API gateway, enforced by Spring Security. - Public Endpoints: A few endpoints are explicitly marked as public. These are necessary for new users to join or for existing users to log in. - `POST /auth/register` - `POST /auth/login` - Protected Endpoints: All other endpoints are protected by default. Accessing them requires a valid JWT sent in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. This includes all endpoints related to booking, checking seat status, managing user profiles, etc. - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): The system implements two roles: `ROLE_USER` and `ROLE_ADMIN`. This is enforced using Spring Security's annotations. - `@PreAuthorize(\"hasRole('ADMIN')\")`: This annotation on a controller method ensures that only users with the `ROLE_ADMIN` claim in their JWT can execute it. For example, an endpoint to add new library seats would be protected this way. - `@PreAuthorize(\"hasRole('USER')\")`: Protects endpoints for standard users. ### 4.5. JWT Authentication Flow (Step-by-Step) 1. Login Request: The user sends their email and password to `POST /auth/login`. 2. Authentication: Spring Security's `AuthenticationManager` uses the custom `UserInfoService` to load the user's details (including the hashed password) from the database. It compares the provided password with the stored hash. 3. Token Generation: If authentication is successful, the `AuthController` calls `jwtService.generateToken(username)`. 4. Inside `JwtService.generateToken`: a. It defines the claims for the JWT. A claim is a piece of information asserted about the subject. - `iss` (Issuer): The service that issued the token (e.g., \"iLibrary-Backend\"). - `sub` (Subject): The username (email) of the user. - `iat` (Issued At): The timestamp when the token was created. - `exp` (Expiration): The timestamp when the token will expire (e.g., 1 hour from now). - Custom Claims: Crucially, it adds the user's roles (e.g., `roles: [\"ROLE_USER\"]`). b. It signs the token using a secret key (e.g., HMAC-SHA256). The secret key is a high- entropy string stored securely in `application.properties` (and ideally in a secrets manager in production). c. The result is a three-part Base64-encoded string: `header.payload.signature`. 5. Token Response: The JWT is returned to the client in the response body. The client must store this token securely (e.g., in memory or `localStorage`). 6. Subsequent Requests: For every subsequent request to a protected endpoint, the client includes the token in the `Authorization` header. 7. Token Validation (`JwtAuthenticationFilter`): a. The filter extracts the token from the header. b. It uses `JwtService` to parse and validate the token. This involves: i. Checking the signature with the same secret key. If the signature is invalid, the token has been tampered with. ii. Checking the expiration (`exp`) claim. If the token is expired, it's rejected. c. If valid, the claims (subject and roles) are extracted. d. A `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` is created with the user's details and authorities (roles). e. This token is set in the `SecurityContextHolder`. The request is now considered authenticated. 8. Controller Access: The request proceeds to the controller, which can now access the authenticated user's principal and roles to perform authorization checks. ### 4.6. Authorization Rules and Edge Cases - Rule: A `USER` can only manage their own bookings. - Implementation: When a user calls `POST /bookings/check-out/{bookingId}`, the `BookingService` must not only find the booking by `bookingId` but also verify that `booking.getUser().getId()` matches the ID of the currently authenticated user. Failing to do this would allow User A to check out User B's booking. - Rule: An `ADMIN` can view all bookings, but a `USER` can only view their own. - Implementation: The `GET /bookings` endpoint would have two different logic paths based on the user's role. If the user has `ROLE_ADMIN`, the service returns `bookingRepository.findAll()`. If they have `ROLE_USER`, it returns `bookingRepository.findByUserId(currentUserId)`. - Edge Case: What if an admin's role is revoked while they have an active session? The JWT they hold is still valid until it expires, and it still contains the `ROLE_ADMIN` claim. This is a classic stateless token problem. - Mitigation 1 (Simple): Keep token expiration times short (e.g., 15-30 minutes). - Mitigation 2 (Complex): Implement a token blocklist. When a user's roles change, their token ID (`jti` claim) is added to a blocklist in a fast-access store like Redis. The `JwtAuthenticationFilter` would need to check this blocklist on every request, which sacrifices the pure statelessness of JWTs but provides immediate revocation. This system does not implement this, trading immediate revocation for simplicity. --- ## 5. Database Layer ### 5.1. Schema Design Rationale The database schema is designed around the core entities of the business domain, following a standard relational model. - `user` table: Stores user credentials and profile information. `email` is the username and has a unique constraint. `password` stores a bcrypt hash, not plaintext. `roles` stores the authorization level. - `seat` table: Represents the physical inventory. `seat_number` is a business identifier. The `status` column (`AVAILABLE`, `BOOKED`, `OCCUPIED`) is the most frequently updated field and is critical for the application's real-time view. - `subscription` table: Tracks a user's membership. It has a foreign key to the `user` table (`user_id`). The `status` (`ACTIVE`, `INACTIVE`) and `end_date` are crucial for enforcing access rights. The one-to-one mapping (`@OneToOne`) from `User` to `Subscription` implies every user has exactly one subscription record. - `booking` table: An association table linking a `user` to a `seat` at a specific time. It includes foreign keys to both `user` and `seat`. `booking_time`, `check_in_time`, and `check_out_time` provide an audit trail. The `status` (`CONFIRMED`, `CHECKED_IN`, `COMPLETED`, `CANCELLED`) tracks the lifecycle of a booking. Diagrammatic Representation: ``` +--------------+ +----------------+ | user | | subscription | +--------------+ +----------------+ | PK user_id | 1--1 | PK sub_id | | email |<------| FK user_id | | password | | status | | ... | | end_date | +--------------+ +----------------+ | | | 1.. (A user can have many bookings) | +--------------+ | booking | +--------------+ | PK booking_id| | FK user_id |-----> (A booking belongs to one user) | FK seat_id |-----> (A booking is for one seat) | status | | booking_time | +--------------+ | | ..1 (A seat can have many bookings over time) | +--------------+ | seat | +--------------+ | PK seat_id | | seat_number | | status | +--------------+ ``` ### 5.2. Indexing Decisions While not explicitly defined in the JPA entities (can be added with `@Index`), a production database would require the following indexes for performance: - Primary Keys: All `id` columns are primary keys, which are automatically indexed. - Foreign Keys: `user_id` and `seat_id` in the `booking` table, and `user_id` in the `subscription` table. Most database systems automatically index foreign keys, but it's critical to ensure this. These are essential for efficient `JOIN` operations. - `user.email`: A unique index on the `email` column is mandatory for fast lookups during login (`WHERE email = ?`). - `seat.status`: The `seat` table will be frequently queried to find available seats (`WHERE status = 'AVAILABLE'`). This is a strong candidate for an index. However, since the cardinality is low (only a few distinct statuses), the database's query planner might sometimes opt for a full table scan anyway. - `booking.status` and `booking.check_in_time`: The `SeatReleaseScheduler` needs to find bookings that are `CONFIRMED` and older than a certain time, or `CHECKED_IN` and older than a certain time. A composite index on `(status, check_in_time)` would be highly effective for this background job. ### 5.3. Relationships and Constraints - `@OneToOne(mappedBy = \"user\")` in `User` and `@OneToOne @JoinColumn(name = \"user_id\")` in `Subscription`: This enforces that one user can have only one subscription record. - `@ManyToOne` in `Booking`: Links a booking to a single user and a single seat. - `@OneToMany(mappedBy = \"user\")` in `User`: Allows navigating from a `User` to all of their `Booking`s. The `mappedBy` attribute indicates that the `Booking` entity is the owner of the relationship (where the foreign key column is). - Database-level Constraints: Unique constraints on `user.email` and `seat.seat_number` are critical for data integrity, preventing duplicate records even if the application logic fails. Foreign key constraints (`ON DELETE RESTRICT` by default) prevent orphaned records, e.g., you cannot delete a `User` if they still have `Booking`s. ### 5.4. Transaction Boundaries The system uses Spring's declarative transaction management with the `@Transactional` annotation. - Where it's used: On `Service` layer methods that perform write operations or require a consistent view of the data. - Example: `BookingService.createBooking` is the canonical example. It must read the status of a seat and then write a new booking and update the seat's status. If this happens in two separate transactions, a race condition could occur. Wrapping the entire method in `@Transactional` ensures it executes within a single database transaction, providing ACID guarantees. - Propagation: The default propagation level is `REQUIRED`, which means if a transaction already exists, the method will join it; otherwise, it will create a new one. This is suitable for most use cases in this application. - Rollback: By default, transactions are rolled back for any `RuntimeException` but not for checked `Exception`s. This is why it's good practice to use custom runtime exceptions (like `SeatNotAvailableException`) to signal business failures that should trigger a rollback. ### 5.5. Failure Scenarios (Partial Writes, Retries) - Partial Writes: - Scenario: Imagine `createBooking` was not transactional. The code saves the new `Booking` record, but before it can update the `Seat` status, the server crashes. The result is an inconsistent state: a booking exists for a seat that is still marked as `AVAILABLE`. - Prevention: `@Transactional` prevents this entirely. The database changes are not made permanent (`COMMIT`) until the method completes successfully. If an error occurs at any point, the transaction is rolled back, and the database is left untouched. - Retries: - Scenario: A `PessimisticLockingFailureException` or `DeadlockLoserDataAccessException` can occur in high-concurrency scenarios. For example, two transactions deadlocking each other while trying to acquire locks on seats. - Strategy: This system does not have an explicit retry mechanism. The exception would propagate up and result in a `500` or `409` error. For a more resilient system, one could implement a retry AOP aspect (e.g., using Spring Retry) that re-attempts a `@Transactional` method a few times if it fails due to a transient locking issue. However, this adds complexity and should only be done for specific, known-to-be-transient failures. ### 5.6. Data Consistency Guarantees The system provides strong consistency for all its operations, thanks to the combination of a single monolithic application and a single ACID-compliant database (MySQL). - Read-Your-Writes: When a user books a seat, the subsequent API call to view their bookings will immediately reflect the new booking. - Atomic Operations: Multi-step business logic is executed within transactions, ensuring all- or-nothing completion. - Pessimistic Locking: For the critical \"find and update seat\" operation, the application should ideally use a pessimistic lock (`@Lock(LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_WRITE)` on the repository method). This tells the database to lock the seat row for the duration of the transaction, forcing concurrent requests for the same seat to wait. This is the safest way to prevent two users from booking the same seat simultaneously. The alternative, optimistic locking (`@Version` column), would allow the second user's transaction to fail with an exception, which is also a valid but different user experience. --- ## 6. AI / ML Components ### 6.1. Why AI is Integrated In the `iLibrary-Backend` repository, there are no AI or Machine Learning components integrated. This is a deliberate and appropriate design decision. The problem domain—managing library seat bookings—is a deterministic, transactional process. The business rules are explicit and do not require probabilistic decision-making, pattern recognition from unstructured data, or content generation. Introducing AI/ML into this system would be an anti-pattern. It would add significant complexity, cost, and non-determinism for no clear benefit. For instance, using an ML model to \"predict\" seat availability would be vastly inferior to simply querying the database for the ground truth (`SELECT FROM seat WHERE status = 'AVAILABLE'`). ### 6.2 - 6.8. Sections on Fine-tuning, RAG, Prompt Design, etc., are not applicable to this repository as there is no AI/ML functionality. --- ## 7. RAG System Design Not applicable to this repository. --- ## 8. Fine-Tuning Strategy Not applicable to this repository. ------ ## 4. Backend (Spring Boot / API Layer) ### 4.1. Controller Design Philosophy The controllers in this application follow a resource-oriented design, which is a core tenet of RESTful web services. Each controller manages a specific domain or resource. - `AuthController`: Manages the non-resource-specific actions of authentication and user registration. Its endpoints (`/auth/login`, `/auth/register`) are the public gateways to the system. - `BookingController`: Manages the `Booking` resource. It handles state changes related to a user's booking lifecycle (create, check-in, check-out). - `SeatController`: Manages the `Seat` resource. It is primarily used for querying seat status and availability, which is a read-heavy operation. - `SubscriptionController`: Manages the `Subscription` resource, handling its creation and status checks. Key Principles Followed: 1. Statelessness: The API is stateless. Every request from a client must contain all the information needed to be understood and processed. The server does not store any session state between requests. The user's authenticated state is carried in the JWT token. 2. Thin Controllers: The controllers are intentionally \"thin.\" Their sole responsibility is to handle HTTP-specific tasks: parsing request bodies, extracting path variables and parameters, invoking the appropriate service method, and formatting the response. They contain no business logic. 3. Uniform Interface: The API uses standard HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`) to manipulate resources, and standard HTTP status codes (`200 OK`, `201 Created`, `400 Bad Request`, `401 Unauthorized`, `404 Not Found`, `409 Conflict`) to communicate outcomes. ### 4.2. DTO vs. Entity Separation A critical architectural principle is the separation of Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) from JPA Entities. - Entities (`@Entity`): These represent the database schema. They are managed by the persistence context and can be lazily loaded, which can cause issues if they are directly serialized and sent over the network. Exposing entities directly can also leak internal database structure and create security vulnerabilities (e.g., accidentally exposing a user's password hash). - DTOs (Plain Old Java Objects - POJOs): These are objects that define the \"shape\" of the data for the API. They are dumb data carriers with no behavior. Current Implementation & Refinement: The current `iLibrary-Backend` project sometimes uses entities directly in the controller layer (e.g., taking a `User` entity in the registration endpoint). While this is convenient for small projects, it's an anti-pattern that should be corrected. Recommended (Ideal) Flow: 1. Request: A `POST` request with a `CreateUserRequestDTO` in its body hits the `AuthController`. 2. Controller: The controller receives the `CreateUserRequestDTO`. 3. Mapping: The controller (or a dedicated `Mapper` service) converts the `CreateUserRequestDTO` into a `User` entity. 4. Service: The `User` entity is passed to the `UserService`. 5. Response: The `UserService` returns a saved `User` entity. This is then mapped to a `UserResponseDTO` (which would exclude sensitive fields like the password) before being sent back in the HTTP response. This separation ensures the API contract is stable even if the internal database schema changes, and it prevents accidental data leakage. ### 4.3. Validation Strategy Input validation is implemented at the boundary of the system—the controller layer—to ensure data integrity before any business logic is executed. The project uses the Bean Validation API (via `spring-boot-starter-validation`). How it Works: - Annotations: Constraints are declared directly on the fields of the DTOs (or entities, in the current implementation) using annotations like `@NotNull`, `@Email`, `@Size`, and `@NotBlank`. - Triggering: The `@Valid` annotation is used on controller method parameters (e.g., `@PostMapping(\"/register\") public String addUser(@RequestBody @Valid User user)`). This tells Spring to trigger the validation process. - Exception Handling: If validation fails, a `MethodArgumentNotValidException` (for `@RequestBody`) or `ConstraintViolationException` is thrown. This is caught by the `RestResponseEntityExceptionHandler`, which formats a `400 Bad Request` response with a clear, structured error message detailing which fields are invalid and why. This prevents invalid data from ever reaching the service layer. ### 4.4. Security Boundaries The primary security boundary is managed by Spring Security. The configuration (in a class like `SecurityConfig`) defines which parts of the API are public and which are protected. - Public Boundary: Endpoints like `/auth/login`, `/auth/register`, and perhaps `GET /seats/availability` are configured to be `permitAll()`. These can be accessed by any client without authentication. - Protected Boundary: All other endpoints, especially those that create or modify data (e.g., `POST /bookings/book/`, `POST /admin/`), are protected. The configuration requires a valid, authenticated user (`.anyRequest().authenticated()`). Access is only granted if the `JwtAuthenticationFilter` successfully validates a JWT from the request. - Role-Based Boundary: Further granularity is achieved with role-based access control (RBAC). For example: ```java .requestMatchers(\"/admin/\").hasRole(\"ADMIN\") .requestMatchers(\"/bookings/\").hasAnyRole(\"USER\", \"ADMIN\") ``` This ensures that only users with the `ROLE_ADMIN` (as defined in their `User` entity) can access administrative endpoints. ### 4.5. JWT Authentication Flow (Step-by-Step) 1. User Login: The user sends their email and password to `POST /auth/login`. 2. Authentication: Spring Security's `AuthenticationManager` uses the custom `UserInfoService` to load the user from the database by email and compares the provided password with the stored bcrypt hash. 3. Token Generation: If authentication is successful, the `AuthController` calls the `JwtService.generateToken()` method. - Inside `JwtService`, a new JWT is built. - Claims: The token's payload (claims) is populated with essential, non-sensitive user information: `sub` (subject, usually the email/username), `roles` (the user's roles), `iat` (issued at), and `exp` (expiration time). - Signing: The token header and payload are encoded, combined, and then signed using a secret key (e.g., HMAC-SHA256). This signature ensures the token's integrity; any modification will invalidate it. 4. Token Issuance: The signed JWT string is returned to the user in the login response body. 5. Token Storage (Client-Side): The client application (web or mobile) stores this token securely (e.g., in `localStorage` for a web app, though `HttpOnly` cookies are safer against XSS). 6. Subsequent Requests: For every subsequent request to a protected endpoint, the client includes the JWT in the `Authorization` header: `Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>`. 7. Token Validation (Filter): The `JwtAuthenticationFilter` intercepts the request. - It extracts the token from the header. - It calls `JwtService` to parse and validate the token. Validation involves: - Checking the signature with the secret key. - Checking the expiration time (`exp` claim). - Ensuring the token is well-formed. 8. Security Context Population: If the token is valid, the filter extracts the user's identity (`sub` and `roles` claims), creates an `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` object representing the authenticated user, and sets it in the `SecurityContextHolder`. 9. Access Granted: The request proceeds to the controller. Downstream logic can now access the authenticated user's details via the `SecurityContext`. ### 4.6. Authorization Rules and Edge Cases - Standard Rules: Users can only manage their own resources. For example, in `BookingService.checkOut(bookingId)`, there should be a check: `if (!booking.getUser().getId().equals(currentUser.getId())) { throw new UnauthorizedAccessException(); }`. This prevents a user from checking out another user's booking. - Admin Override: Admin users (`ROLE_ADMIN`) often bypass these ownership checks. The logic would look like: ```java boolean isOwner = booking.getUser().getId().equals(currentUser.getId()); boolean isAdmin = currentUser.getRoles().contains(\"ROLE_ADMIN\"); if (!isOwner && !isAdmin) { throw new UnauthorizedAccessException(); } ``` - Edge Case: Token Expiration: If a user's token expires mid-session, the `JwtAuthenticationFilter` will reject the request, and the client will receive a `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` response. The client-side application must be designed to handle this, typically by redirecting the user to the login page to get a new token. - Edge Case: Role Change: If an admin revokes a user's roles, the change is not reflected until the user's current JWT expires and they are forced to log in again to get a new token with updated roles. This is a fundamental characteristic of JWT-based systems. For immediate revocation, a token blocklist (e.g., in Redis) would be required, which adds complexity. ### 4.7. Error Handling Patterns The system uses a centralized error handling mechanism via a `@ControllerAdvice` class, `RestResponseEntityExceptionHandler`. - Pattern: Instead of `try-catch` blocks in controllers, services throw specific, unchecked exceptions when a business rule is violated. - Specific Exceptions: `SeatNotAvailableException`, `BookingNotFoundException`, `SubscriptionExpiredException`. These carry semantic meaning. - Centralized Handler: The `@ControllerAdvice` class has multiple `@ExceptionHandler` methods, each one tailored to a specific exception type. - `handleBookingNotFound(BookingNotFoundException ex)` returns a `4_04 Not Found`. - `handleSeatNotAvailable(SeatNotAvailableException ex)` returns a `409 Conflict`. - `handleConstraintViolationException(...)` returns a `400 Bad Request`. - Benefit: This keeps the controller and service code clean and focused on the \"happy path\" logic. Error handling is consistent across the entire API, and it provides structured, machine- readable error responses to the client, which is crucial for good API design. --- ## 5. Database Layer ### 5.1. Schema Design Rationale The database schema is designed around the core entities of the library system. It's a relational model that balances normalization with query performance. Tables (Inferred from Entities): - `users`: Stores user information (`id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `roles`). - `email` has a `UNIQUE` constraint to prevent duplicate accounts. - `subscriptions`: Stores subscription details for each user. - `id`, `user_id` (foreign key to `users`), `start_date`, `end_date`, `status` (`ACTIVE`, `EXPIRED`). - A user has a `@OneToOne` or `@OneToMany` relationship with subscriptions (depending on whether history is kept). A `@OneToOne` to the current active subscription is common. - `seats`: Represents the physical seats in the library. - `id`, `seat_number`, `status` (`AVAILABLE`, `BOOKED`, `OCCUPIED`, `MAINTENANCE`). - `seat_number` should have a `UNIQUE` constraint. - `bookings`: An associative table that links users and seats for a specific time. - `id` (UUID is a good choice), `user_id` (FK to `users`), `seat_id` (FK to `seats`), `booking_time`, `check_in_time`, `check_out_time`, `status` (`CONFIRMED`, `CHECKED_IN`, `COMPLETED`, `EXPIRED`). Rationale: - Normalization: User and seat information is stored separately to avoid redundancy. A `bookings` table then records the relationship between them, which is a standard normalized design. - Status Enums: Using `ENUM` types or `String` representations for status fields (`SeatStatus`, `BookingStatus`) makes application logic clear and prevents invalid state values. - Timestamps: `booking_time`, `check_in_time`, etc., are crucial for the system's logic, especially the automated seat release scheduler. `created_at` and `updated_at` columns (often handled by `@CreationTimestamp` and `@UpdateTimestamp`) are vital for auditing. ### 5.2. Indexing Decisions Proper indexing is the most critical factor for database performance. - Primary Keys (`id`): Automatically indexed. All `findById` lookups are fast. - Foreign Keys (`user_id`, `seat_id`): Spring Data JPA/Hibernate typically creates indexes on foreign key columns. This is essential for efficient `JOIN` operations (e.g., finding all bookings for a user). - Query-Driven Indexes: Indexes must be added based on common query patterns. - `users(email)`: A unique index on the `email` column is mandatory for fast login lookups and to enforce uniqueness. - `seats(status)`: An index on the `status` column is critical for the `GET /seats/availability` endpoint, which will run a query like `SELECT FROM seats WHERE status = 'AVAILABLE'`. Without this, the database would have to do a full table scan every time a user checks for seats. - `bookings(status, user_id)`: A composite index on `(status, user_id)` would speed up finding a user's active bookings (`WHERE user_id = ? AND status IN ('CONFIRMED', 'CHECKED_IN')`). - `bookings(status, booking_time)`: A composite index on `(status, booking_time)` is essential for the `SeatReleaseScheduler`, which needs to efficiently find all bookings that are `CONFIRMED` and older than a certain threshold. ### 5.3. Relationships and Constraints - `User` to `Subscription`: `@OneToMany`. A user can have multiple subscriptions over time (a history). Or, `@OneToOne` if only the current one matters. The foreign key is in the `subscriptions` table. - `User` to `Booking`: `@OneToMany`. A user can make many bookings. The foreign key (`user_id`) is in the `bookings` table. - `Seat` to `Booking`: `@OneToMany`. A seat can be part of many bookings over time. The foreign key (`seat_id`) is in the `bookings` table. - Constraints: - `NOT NULL`: Most foreign key and status columns should be non-nullable. - `UNIQUE`: `users.email`, `seats.seat_number`. - Cascading: Cascade types should be used carefully. `CascadeType.ALL` from `User` to `Booking` would be dangerous—deleting a user would delete all their past booking history. `CascadeType.PERSIST` and `CascadeType.MERGE` are often safer. Deleting a user should probably be a \"soft delete\" (setting an `is_active` flag to `false`) to preserve historical data integrity. ### 5.4. Transaction Boundaries Spring's `@Transactional` annotation is used to define transaction boundaries at the service layer. - Where it's used: Any service method that performs a write operation, especially those modifying multiple entities, must be transactional. - `BookingService.createBooking()`: This is the canonical example. It must create a `Booking` row AND update a `Seat` row. `@Transactional` ensures that if the seat update fails for any reason, the booking creation is rolled back, preventing an inconsistent state (a booking for a seat that still shows as available). - `BookingService.checkIn()`: Updates both the `Booking` and `Seat` status. - Read-Only Transactions: Methods that only read data (e.g., `seatService.findAvailableSeats()`) can be marked with `@Transactional(readOnly = true)`. This provides a performance hint to the persistence provider and the database, which can apply certain optimizations. ### 5.5. Failure Scenarios (Data Layer) - Race Condition (Booking): Two users request `POST /bookings/book/101` for the last seat at the same time. - Without Locking: Both threads could read the seat status as `AVAILABLE`, both create a booking, and the last one to write wins. The first user thinks they have a booking, but the seat status is updated by the second user. This is a classic race condition. - Mitigation (Pessimistic Locking): The `BookingService` should use `seatRepository.findByIdPessimistic(...)` or an equivalent `@Lock(LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_WRITE)` annotation. The first transaction to read the seat places a database-level lock on the row. The second transaction will block until the first one commits or rolls back, at which point it will read the (now `BOOKED`) status and fail cleanly. - Mitigation (Optimistic Locking): Add a `@Version` column to the `Seat` entity. When updating the seat, the `UPDATE` statement includes a `WHERE version = ?` clause. If another transaction has already updated the seat (and incremented its version), the `UPDATE` will affect 0 rows, and Hibernate will throw an `OptimisticLockException`, which can be handled to inform the user to try again. Pessimistic locking is often simpler and more appropriate for high-contention resources like seats. - Partial Writes: This is exactly what `@Transactional` prevents. Without it, if the `bookingRepository.save()` succeeded but the `seatRepository.save()` failed (e.g., due to a brief network issue), the database would be left in an inconsistent state. - Deadlocks: If two transactions try to acquire locks on the same set of resources but in a different order, they can deadlock. For example, T1 locks `Seat A` then tries to lock `Seat B`, while T2 locks `Seat B` then tries to lock `Seat A`. The database will detect the deadlock and abort one of the transactions, causing a `DeadlockLoserDataAccessException` to be thrown by Spring. This is rare in this application's simple workflows but can be debugged by ensuring all transactions lock resources in a consistent, canonical order. ### 5.6. Data Consistency Guarantees - Strong Consistency: Within the monolith, the system guarantees strong consistency for all operations, thanks to the ACID properties of the single relational database and the use of transactions. When an API call returns `201 Created` for a booking, the user can be certain that the booking and the updated seat status have been committed to the database and will be visible to all subsequent requests. - No Eventual Consistency: The system does not rely on eventual consistency models, which are common in distributed microservices architectures. This simplifies the logic immensely, as developers do not need to reason about stale data. --- ## 6. AI / ML Components ### 6.1. Why AI is (Not) Integrated The `iLibrary-Backend` system, in its current form, does not contain any AI or Machine Learning components. This is an intentional and appropriate design choice for the problem it solves. The core functionality—managing users, seats, and bookings—is deterministic and rule-based. AI/ML is not needed for: - Checking if a user's subscription is active. - Verifying if a seat's status is `AVAILABLE`. - Creating a booking record. These are straightforward CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations that do not involve prediction, pattern recognition, or generation of new content. Introducing AI/ML into these core workflows would add immense complexity, cost, and latency for zero benefit. ### 6.2. Potential Future AI/ML Integrations While not part of the current scope, one could envision future features where AI/ML would be valuable. These would be new, distinct modules, not modifications to the core booking engine. - Predictive Occupancy: An ML model could be trained on historical booking and check-in data to predict library occupancy levels. - Problem: Help students decide the best time to visit. - Data: `bookings` table (check-in/out times), day of the week, time of day, proximity to exams. - Model: A time-series forecasting model (like ARIMA or an LSTM). - Smart Seat Recommendations: Instead of just showing a list of available seats, an ML model could recommend the \"best\" seat for a user. - Problem: Improve user satisfaction. - Data: User's past booking locations, duration of stay, seat features (e.g., near window, power outlet), current occupancy patterns. - Model: A recommendation engine (collaborative filtering or content-based). - Sentiment Analysis on Feedback: If a user feedback feature were added, sentiment analysis could be used to automatically categorize feedback and flag urgent issues. - Problem: Reduce administrative overhead in managing user feedback. - Model: A pre-trained sentiment classification model. These remain firmly in the \"future roadmap\" category and do not reflect the current architecture. --- ## 7. RAG System Design This section is not applicable to the `iLibrary-Backend` repository. A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system is designed to answer questions or generate content by first retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base. This is useful for chatbots, Q&A systems, and document summarization. The `iLibrary-Backend` is a transactional, operational system, not a knowledge-based Q&A system. --- ## 8. Fine-Tuning Strategy This section is not applicable to the `iLibrary-Backend` repository. Fine-tuning is the process of further training a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) on a specific dataset to improve its performance on a specialized task. Since this system does not use any LLMs, there is no fine-tuning strategy. --- ## 9. Security Deep Dive ### 9.1. Threat Model The threat model considers who might attack the system and what they might want to achieve. - Actors: - Unauthenticated Outsider: A malicious actor on the internet. - Authenticated but Low-Privilege User: A regular student (`ROLE_USER`). - Privileged User (Insider Threat): A library administrator (`ROLE_ADMIN`). - Assets: - User PII: Personally Identifiable Information in the `users` table (name, email). - System Integrity: The correctness of the seat and booking status. - System Availability: The ability of legitimate users to access the service. - Goals of an Attacker: - Gain free access to the library (book a seat without a valid subscription). - View or steal other users' personal information. - Prevent other users from booking seats (Denial of Service). - Elevate their privileges from `ROLE_USER` to `ROLE_ADMIN`. ### 9.2. Attack Vectors & Mitigations - Vector: SQL Injection - Risk: An attacker could try to manipulate database queries to bypass logins or extract data. - Mitigation: Effectively Mitigated. The exclusive use of Spring Data JPA with parameterized queries (which happens automatically when you use repository methods like `findByEmail(email)`) provides robust protection against SQL Injection. Raw, concatenated SQL strings are not used. - Vector: Broken Authentication (Token Theft) - Risk: If an attacker steals a user's JWT, they can impersonate that user until the token expires. - How: This could happen via a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack on the frontend if the token is stored in `localStorage`, or through a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack if communication is not encrypted. - Mitigation: - HTTPS is Mandatory: The `spring.force-ssl` property should be enabled in production to ensure all communication is encrypted, preventing MiTM attacks. - Short Token Expiration: JWTs have a configurable, short lifespan (e.g., 15-60 minutes). This limits the window of opportunity for an attacker. The system should use a refresh token mechanism for a seamless user experience. - Secure Token Storage (Client-Side): The frontend should ideally store JWTs in `HttpOnly` cookies, which cannot be accessed by JavaScript, mitigating XSS-based token theft. - Vector: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) - Risk: A `ROLE_USER` could try to access or modify another user's resources by guessing their ID. For example, User 123 sends a request for `POST /bookings/checkout/789` where booking 789 belongs to User 456. - Mitigation: Partially Implemented, Requires Vigilance. This must be mitigated with explicit authorization checks in the service layer, as described in section 4.6. Every method that takes a resource ID must verify that the currently authenticated principal is authorized to act on that resource (either as its owner or as an admin). Relying on the client to only show a user their own resources is insecure. - Vector: Privilege Escalation - Risk: A user could try to register themselves as an admin or modify their JWT to include the `ROLE_ADMIN`. - Mitigation: - Token Signature: The JWT's signature prevents tampering. Any change to the `roles` claim in the payload will invalidate the signature, and the `JwtAuthenticationFilter` will reject the token. - Registration Logic: The `auth/register` endpoint must be hardened. It should either ignore any `roles` field in the incoming request or explicitly sanitize it to ensure a new user can never self-assign the `ROLE_ADMIN`. The role should be assigned by default to `ROLE_USER`. - Vector: Denial of Service (DoS) - Risk: An attacker could spam the seat booking endpoint, rapidly booking and canceling seats to prevent others from using them. Or, they could spam resource-intensive endpoints to overload the server. - Mitigation: - Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting at the API gateway or using a library like Bucket4j. A user should only be able to make a certain number of booking requests per minute. - Business Logic Constraints: The rule that a user can only have one active booking at a time is itself a form of DoS mitigation against seat hoarding. - Vector: Prompt Injection / RAG Poisoning - Risk: Not Applicable. These are attack vectors relevant to AI/LLM-based systems. --- ## 10. Failure & Debugging Guide ### Component: User Authentication - Common Failure: User sees \"Bad credentials\" or a `401 Unauthorized` error. - Logs to Check: Look for logs from `o.s.s.authentication.ProviderManager` or your `UserInfoService`. - `\"User not found for email: ...\"` -> The email they entered doesn't exist. - `\"Encoded password does not look like BCrypt\"` -> A user might have a `null` or improperly formatted password hash in the DB. - Root Cause Analysis: 1. Did the user type the correct password? (Most common) 2. Is the user's account present and active in the `users` table? 3. During registration, was the password correctly hashed with `BCryptPasswordEncoder` before saving? A common bug is to save the plaintext password. - Step-by-Step Fix: 1. Verify the user exists in the database. 2. If it's a password issue, use a temporary admin function to reset their password, ensuring it gets hashed correctly on save. 3. Check the registration code path in `UserService` to confirm `passwordEncoder.encode()` is being called. ### Component: Seat Booking - Common Failure: User gets a `409 Conflict` \"Seat is not available\" error, even when they think it should be. - Logs to Check: Look for application logs in `BookingService` that say \"Attempted to book an unavailable seat.\" - Root Cause Analysis: 1. Race Condition: Another user booked it fractions of a second earlier. This is expected behavior. 2. Stale Data on Client: The user's frontend UI was showing stale availability data. They loaded the page 5 minutes ago, and the seat was booked in the interim. 3. Scheduler Failure: The `SeatReleaseScheduler` failed to run, so an `EXPIRED` booking was never cleared, and the seat was never returned to `AVAILABLE` status. - Step-by-Step Fix: 1. Query the `seats` table in the database directly: `SELECT status FROM seats WHERE id = ?`. This gives you the ground truth. 2. Check the `bookings` table for the corresponding `seat_id` to see who has it booked or checked in. 3. Check the application logs for any exceptions thrown by `SeatReleaseScheduler`. The cron expression might be invalid, or it might be failing due to a database connection issue. ### Component: Automated Seat Release (`SeatReleaseScheduler`) - Common Failure: Abandoned seats are not being freed up. Library occupancy is incorrectly high. - Logs to Check: - Look for logs indicating the scheduler is running: `\"Running automated seat release task...\"` - Look for exceptions within the scheduled method's execution. A single uncaught exception can halt the execution for that run. - Root Cause Analysis: 1. `@EnableScheduling` is Missing: The main application class is missing the `@EnableScheduling` annotation. 2. Invalid Cron Expression: The `cron` expression in the `@Scheduled` annotation is malformed. Spring will log an error on startup. 3. Time Zone Issues: The server's time zone might be different from the database's time zone. A query for bookings older than 30 minutes might not return the correct results if the clocks are out of sync. 4. Logic Bug: The query to find expired bookings is incorrect. - Step-by-Step Fix: 1. Verify `@EnableScheduling` is present. 2. Validate the cron expression using an online tool. 3. Explicitly set the time zone for the scheduler and the database queries to a common standard like UTC. 4. Unit test the repository method that finds expired bookings, passing in various date/time scenarios to ensure it behaves correctly. --- ## 11. Performance & Scaling ### 11.1. Bottlenecks - Database: The database is the most likely bottleneck for any transactional application. - Unindexed Queries: A single frequently-run query without a proper index (like checking seat availability) can bring the entire system to its knees under load by causing full table scans. - Connection Pool Exhaustion: If transactions are too long or there are too many concurrent requests, the application can run out of available database connections. - Application CPU: For a simple CRUD application like this, the CPU is less likely to be the bottleneck unless there is a very high volume of requests causing constant serialization/deserialization and request processing overhead. - Single Point of Failure: The monolithic application instance is a single point of failure. If the process crashes, the entire service is down. ### 11.2. Load Behavior - Read-Heavy: The system is likely to be read-heavy. Many users will be checking seat availability (`GET /seats/availability`) for every one user who successfully books a seat (`POST /bookings/book`). - Spiky Traffic: Load will be spiky, concentrated around peak hours (e.g., lunchtimes, evenings, exam periods). The system needs to handle these bursts. ### 11.3. Caching Strategy Caching is crucial for handling the read-heavy load. - Level 1: Local Cache (In-Memory) - Candidate: `GET /seats/availability`. The list of available seats changes, but not necessarily every second. - Implementation: Use Spring's `@Cacheable(\"availableSeats\")` annotation on the `seatService.findAvailableSeats()` method. Configure a short TTL (Time To Live), e.g., 5-10 seconds. - Trade-off: This provides a huge performance boost, serving many requests from memory without hitting the DB. The cost is that users might see slightly stale data (a seat shown as available might have just been booked). This is an acceptable trade-off for this use case. - Invalidation: The cache must be invalidated when a seat's status changes. Use `@CacheEvict(\"availableSeats\", allEntries=true)` on the service methods that change seat status (e.g., `createBooking`, `checkIn`, `checkOut`). - Level 2: Distributed Cache (Redis) - If the application is scaled horizontally (see below), a local cache is insufficient, as each instance would have its own inconsistent cache. - Implementation: A distributed cache like Redis would be needed. All application instances would connect to the same Redis server to store and retrieve cached data. Spring Cache provides seamless integration with Redis. ### 11.4. Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling - Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up): Give the single EC2 instance more CPU and RAM. This is the simplest approach and should be the first step. It's easy to do but has an upper limit and can be expensive. - Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out): Run multiple instances of the application behind a load balancer. - Readiness: The application is stateless, which makes it an excellent candidate for horizontal scaling. A load balancer can route requests to any available instance without issue. - Considerations: - Database Connections: The database connection pool size must be managed carefully. `(Number of instances) (Pool size per instance)` should not exceed the database's maximum connection limit. - Distributed Cache: As mentioned, a local cache won't work. A distributed cache (Redis) becomes necessary. - Scheduler De-duplication: If you run 3 instances, the `SeatReleaseScheduler` will try to run on all 3 simultaneously, causing conflicts. You need a distributed locking mechanism (e.g., using ShedLock with a JDBC or Redis backend) to ensure that only one instance at a time executes the scheduled task. ### 11.5. AI Cost Control - Not Applicable. --- ## 12. Testing Strategy ### 12.1. Unit Tests - Scope: Test a single class in isolation. Dependencies are mocked. - Target: `Service` classes are the primary target for unit tests. - Example (`BookingService`): - To test `createBooking`, you would mock `SeatRepository`, `BookingRepository`, and `UserRepository`. - Test Case 1: `when(seatRepository.findById(...))` returns an available seat. Assert that `bookingRepository.save()` and `seatRepository.save()` are called exactly once. - Test Case 2: `when(seatRepository.findById(...))` returns a booked seat. Assert that a `SeatNotAvailableException` is thrown and that no `save()` methods are called. - Test Case 3: Test the authorization logic by mocking the current user and the booking's owner. - Tools: JUnit 5, Mockito. ### 12.2. Integration Tests - Scope: Test how multiple components work together. This typically involves starting up a slice of the Spring application context and often uses a real (or in-memory) database. - Target: `Controller` and `Repository` layers. - Example (`BookingController`): - Use `@SpringBootTest` and `MockMvc` to send a simulated HTTP request to `POST /bookings/book/{seatId}`. - The test would use a real database (like an H2 in-memory database or Testcontainers with a real MySQL instance) that is seeded with test data before the test runs. - Assert that the HTTP response code is `201 Created`. - Query the database directly to verify that a new row was added to the `bookings` table and the corresponding `seats` row was updated correctly. - Tools: Spring Boot Test, MockMvc, H2 Database, Testcontainers. ### 12.3. Security Tests - Scope: Test the security configuration and authorization rules. - Implementation: Use Spring Security's testing support with `MockMvc`. - Example: - Test Case 1: Send a request to a protected endpoint without a JWT. Assert that the response is `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden`. - Test Case 2: Send a request to an admin-only endpoint (`/admin/`) with a JWT belonging to a `ROLE_USER`. Assert that the response is `403 Forbidden`. - Test Case 3: Send a request to an admin-only endpoint with a `ROLE_ADMIN` JWT. Assert that the response is `200 OK`. - Tools: `@WithMockUser(username=\"user\", roles=\"USER\")` and other Spring Security test annotations. ### 12.4. AI Evaluation / RAG Relevance Tests - Not Applicable. --- ## 13. Versioning & Evolution ### 13.1. How This System Evolves The system will evolve by adding new features or modifying existing ones in response to business needs. The monolithic structure allows for easy refactoring in the early stages. As the system and the team grow, it might evolve by extracting well-defined, loosely-coupled components into separate microservices. A prime candidate for extraction would be a future `NotificationService` or `PaymentService`. ### 13.2. Backward Compatibility Maintaining backward compatibility is crucial for not breaking client applications. - Never Make Breaking Changes to a Released API Version: Once an endpoint is public, its request/response contract should not be changed in a backward-incompatible way. - Compatible Change: Adding a new, optional field to a JSON response. Existing clients will simply ignore it. - Breaking Change: Renaming or removing a field from a JSON response, or changing a field's data type. Existing clients relying on that field will break. ### 13.3. Breaking Change Strategy When a breaking change is unavoidable, it must be introduced in a new version of the API. - API Versioning: The most common strategy is URI versioning. - All current endpoints should be moved under a `/v1/` prefix (e.g., `/v1/bookings/book/{seatId}`). - When a breaking change is needed for the booking process, a new `BookingControllerV2` is created, and its endpoints are exposed under `/v2/bookings/...`. - The old `/v1/` endpoints must be maintained for a deprecation period, allowing clients to migrate at their own pace. ### 13.4. Future Roadmap - Payment Gateway Integration: Integrate with Stripe or a similar service to automate subscription payments. This would likely involve adding a `PaymentService` and webhooks to handle payment success/failure events. - Notifications: Add email and/or push notifications for booking confirmations, check-in reminders, and when a user's subscription is about to expire. This is a good candidate for an asynchronous, event-driven component. - Admin Dashboard: The current API has admin roles but likely lacks a comprehensive set of endpoints for an admin dashboard (e.g., manually overriding a seat's status, viewing system- wide statistics, managing all users). - Seat Selection UI: While the backend supports it, a rich frontend could be built to show a visual map of the library, allowing users to pick their seat. - Waitlist/Queueing: If a seat is unavailable, allow a user to join a waitlist and be notified when it becomes free. --- ## 14. Interview-Level Explanations ### Explain to a Junior Developer \"This is a backend for a library app, written in Java using the Spring Boot framework. Think of it like a standard web server. It has three main jobs: it handles user accounts (login, registration), it keeps track of all the seats in the library and whether they're free or taken, and it lets users book those free seats. It's organized into layers: Controllers are the 'front door' that listen for HTTP requests from the app. Services are the 'brain' that contains all the rules, like 'you can't book a seat if your subscription has expired'. Repositories are the 'hands' that talk to the MySQL database to save and retrieve data. We use JWT, which is just a special string, to make sure that once a user logs in, we know who they are on future requests without them having to send their password every time.\" ### Explain to a Senior Backend Engineer \"This is a standard Spring Boot monolithic application serving a REST API for a library management system. It's built on a classic 3-tier architecture: a web layer with resource- oriented controllers, a transactional service layer holding the business logic, and a JPA-based data access layer. Authentication is handled stateless-ly via JWTs, implemented with a custom Spring Security filter. We're using a single MySQL instance for persistence, and we rely heavily on Spring's declarative transactions (`@Transactional`) at the service layer to ensure ACID guarantees, particularly for the booking process which involves atomic updates to the seats and bookings tables. The design prioritizes simplicity and transactional integrity over scalability at this stage, but it's horizontally scalable due to its stateless nature, provided we address scheduler de-duplication with a distributed lock and implement a distributed cache like Redis to replace the current local caching for seat availability.\" ### Explain to an AI Engineer \"The current system is a foundational, deterministic backend for operational tasks—seat booking and user management. It's a classic transactional Java/Spring application and, by design, has no AI/ML components as its current scope is purely rule-based. However, it's generating the very data that could be valuable for future AI features. The `bookings` table, with its rich history of check-in/out times, user IDs, and seat IDs, is a perfect dataset for training a time-series model to predict future library occupancy. We could also leverage this data to build a recommendation engine for seat selection. The current system would act as the data source and the operational backbone, while a future AI service could be built alongside it to consume this data and provide predictive insights back to the user via new API endpoints.\" ### Explain to a Product Manager \"This is the engine that powers our library app. It does everything behind the scenes. When a user creates an account, books a seat, or checks their subscription, the app on their phone is talking to this system. It manages the single source of truth for who our users are and which seats are available right now. We built it as one solid, reliable unit to get to market quickly, focusing on the core features: secure login, real-time seat availability, and a fair booking process. It also has an automated janitor that runs in the background to free up seats that people booked but never used, ensuring the library space is used efficiently. While it doesn't have fancy AI features today, it's collecting all the data we'd need to add things like 'predict how busy the library will be' in the future.\" ### Common Interview Questions + Answers - Q: How do you prevent two users from booking the same seat at the same time? - A: We handle this concurrency issue at the database level. The service method for creating a booking places a pessimistic write lock on the seat's row in the database. This forces any other transaction trying to book the same seat to wait. Once the first transaction is complete, the second one will read the updated seat status (now 'BOOKED') and fail cleanly, informing the second user that the seat is no longer available. This guarantees data consistency. - Q: A user's JWT is stolen. What's the impact, and how do you limit it? - A: The impact is that an attacker can impersonate the user and access any resources they're authorized to. We limit the impact in two main ways: first, by enforcing HTTPS everywhere, which encrypts the token in transit, making it hard to steal. Second, and most importantly, our JWTs have a very short expiration time, typically 15 minutes. This means the attacker only has a small window to use the token. For immediate revocation, a more complex solution like a token blocklist in Redis would be needed, but short-lived tokens provide a strong baseline of security. - Q: The app feels slow when checking for available seats. How would you diagnose and fix this? - A: The first step is to check the database query performance for finding available seats. This is likely a missing index issue on the `status` column of the `seats` table. If the query is already optimized, the next step is to implement a caching strategy. Since many users will be requesting this data, we can cache the list of available seats in memory for a short period, like 10 seconds, using Spring's `@Cacheable`. This would dramatically reduce database load and improve response times. For a multi-server deployment, this would need to be a distributed cache like Redis. --- ## 15. Appendix ### 15.1. Glossary - JWT (JSON Web Token): A compact, URL-safe standard for creating access tokens that assert claims, such as the user's identity and roles. - JPA (Java Persistence API): A Java specification that provides a standard way to map Java objects (Entities) to relational database tables. - Hibernate: The most popular implementation of the JPA specification, used by Spring Boot by default. - DTO (Data Transfer Object): An object that carries data between processes. Used to define the contract of the REST API. - Monolith: An application built as a single, unified unit. - Pessimistic Locking: A locking strategy where a resource is locked when it is read, preventing other transactions from modifying it until the lock is released. - `@Transactional`: A Spring annotation that provides declarative transaction management, ensuring operations are performed as a single, atomic unit. ### 15.2. API Examples (cURL) Register a new user: ```bash curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/auth/register \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{ \"name\": \"Jane Doe\", \"email\": \"jane.doe@example.com\", \"password\": \"securepassword456\", \"roles\": \"ROLE_USER\" }' ``` Log in to get a JWT: ```bash # This command uses `jq` to extract the token from the response TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/auth/login \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{ \"username\": \"jane.doe@example.com\", \"password\": \"securepassword456\" }' | jq -r .token) echo \"Got token: $TOKEN\" ``` Get available seats (using the token): ```bash curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/seats/availability \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" ``` Book a seat (e.g., seat with ID 5): ```bash curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/bookings/book/5 \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" ``` ### 15.3. Pseudocode Pseudocode for the Automated Seat Release Scheduler: ``` FUNCTION runSeatReleaseTask(): // This function runs every 5 minutes via a cron job // 1. Release CONFIRMED bookings not checked into on time CONFIRMED_TIMEOUT_PERIOD = 30 minutes expiredConfirmedBookings = findBookings with status CONFIRMED and booking_time < (NOW - CONFIRMED_TIMEOUT_PERIOD) FOR each booking in expiredConfirmedBookings: BEGIN TRANSACTION seat = getSeatForBooking(booking) seat.status = AVAILABLE booking.status = EXPIRED save(seat) save(booking) // Optional: sendNotification(booking.user, \"Your booking has expired\") COMMIT TRANSACTION // 2. Release CHECKED_IN bookings where user has overstayed (optional feature) MAX_STAY_PERIOD = 4 hours overstayedBookings = findBookings with status CHECKED_IN and check_in_time < (NOW - MAX_STAY_PERIOD) FOR each booking in overstayedBookings: BEGIN TRANSACTION seat = getSeatForBooking(booking) seat.status = AVAILABLE booking.status = COMPLETED booking.check_out_time = NOW save(seat) save(booking) // Optional: sendNotification(booking.user, \"Your session has ended\") COMMIT TRANSACTION ``` ### 15.4. Design Alternatives Rejected and Why - Alternative: Using WebSockets for Real-Time Availability - Idea: Use WebSockets to push real-time seat status updates to all connected clients instantly. - Rejected Why: While this would provide perfect real-time data, it adds significant complexity to both the backend (managing persistent connections) and the frontend. For a library booking system, \"near real-time\" (polling every 10-15 seconds or on user action) is a perfectly acceptable user experience. The trade-off in complexity and server resource usage was not worth the marginal benefit over a simple, cached REST endpoint. - Alternative: Microservices Architecture - Idea: Split the system into `UserService`, `BookingService`, and `SeatService` as separate microservices. - Rejected Why: As detailed in Section 2, the core workflows are tightly coupled and require strong transactional guarantees. A microservices approach would have introduced network latency between calls, required complex distributed transaction patterns like Sagas (which are hard to get right), and significantly increased the operational and deployment overhead. For the current scale and team size, a monolith is far more pragmatic. - Alternative: Using a NoSQL Database (e.g., MongoDB) - Idea: Store data in a document-based NoSQL database. - Rejected Why: The data in this application is highly relational. Users, Seats, and Bookings have clear, structured relationships and constraints. A relational database like MySQL allows us to enforce these relationships at the schema level and provides powerful `JOIN` capabilities and ACID transactions, which are essential for the system's integrity. While a NoSQL database could work, it would require implementing these relations and transactional behaviors in the application code, which is more complex and error-prone than letting the database handle it. ``` ===== END OF Internal Knowledge Base - iLibrary Backend.pdf =====\n"
